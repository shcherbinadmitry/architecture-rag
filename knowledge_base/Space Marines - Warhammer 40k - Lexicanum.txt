They shall be my finest warriors, these men who give themselves to me. Like clay I shall mould them and in the furnace of war forge them. They will be of iron will and steely muscle. In great armour shall I clad them and with the mightiest guns will they be armed. They will be untouched by plague or disease, no sickness will blight them. They will have tactics, strategies and machines such that no foe can best them in battle. They are my bulwark against the Terror. They are the Defenders of Humanity. They are my Space Marines and they shall know no fear.

Emperor of Mankind

The
Adeptus Astartes
(commonly known as
Space Marines
, and colloquially as
Angels of Death
) are one of the most elite and feared fighting forces in the
Imperium of Man
. The primary unit of organisation in the 41st millennium is the
Chapter
, a self-contained army fully equipped with its own transport, non-combatant support staff, etc. There are around a thousand Chapters, each comprising a thousand Space Marines. There are far too few Space Marines to form the Imperium's main military forces; instead they operate as highly mobile strike forces. They are entrusted with the most dangerous missions, such as lightning raids behind enemy lines, infiltration, and tunnel fighting.
Through selection, training, and conditioning, Marines are physically, mentally, and spiritually superior to any other Imperial soldier.

History
Space Marines battle the forces of
Chaos
Originating from the
Thunder Warriors
, the first Space Marines were created from the genetic material of the
Primarchs
after they were spirited away from the
Emperor
by the
Gods of Chaos
in the aftermath of the
Unification Wars
. Twenty
Legions of Space Marines
were created, each from the genetic material of a specific Primarch. The first Astartes were created only by the massive effort of the
Emperor
and countless
Terran
scientists of
Amar Astarte
's
Biotechnical Division
who worked deep within the Himalazia Mountains. The original Astartes gene-seed was unstable and caused its subjects to degrade rapidly, but once it was stabilized by samples provided by newly rediscovered Primarchs, long-term stability was achieved.
The Legions took part in the
Great Crusade
, during which the lost Primarchs were rediscovered and given command of their respective Legion. The Crusade, lasting for two centuries, ended with the treachery of one of the Primarchs,
Horus
, who led at least half of the Legions in a rebellion known as the
Horus Heresy
against the Emperor. In the final battle for control of the future of mankind, Horus was slain by the Emperor. With the rebellion defeated, those Legions which had sided with Horus were driven into the
Eye of Terror
.
The Legions which had remained loyal were eventually reorganised according to the dictates of the
Codex Astartes
, in the event known as the
Second Founding
. Each Legion was divided into several autonomous Chapters, which remain the primary unit of the Space Marines to the current day.
Successive
foundings
over the millennia have created new Chapters. There are now around a thousand Chapters in existence, each Chapter ultimately descending from one of the loyalist Legions. Later in the closing days of the
41st Millennium
the resurrected
Roboute Guilliman
and his
Mechanicum
researchers oversaw the creation of a new generation of Astartes, known as the
Primaris Space Marine
.
To some extent, the Chapters maintain the traditions and character of the Legion they descend from. Chapters adhere to the Codex Astartes in differing degrees, some regarding any deviation from it as virtual heresy; others, notably the
Black Templars
,
Blood Angels
,
Space Wolves
, and
Dark Angels
, only following the Codex in the broadest matters.
Organisation
They shall be pure of both heart and strong of body, untainted by doubt and self-aggrandisement. They will be bright stars in the firmament of battle, angels of death whose shining wings bring swift annihilation to the enemies of man. So shall it be for a thousand times a thousand years, unto the very end of eternity and the extinction of mortal flesh.

Organization of a Space Marine
Chapter
since the introduction of
Primaris Space Marines
Main article:
Chapter
The Adeptus Astartes is comprised of autonomous
Chapters
, each of which is a complete army in itself, possessing its own transport,
Warp
-capable spacecraft, non-combatant personnel, and
fortress-monastery
based on a planet or fleet. There are roughly a thousand Chapters, each led by a Space Marine with the rank of
Chapter Master
. A Chapter's fighting force numbers a nominal 1000 Marines, divided into ten companies, each of which is commanded by a
Captain
. Companies are further divided into squads of ten battle-brothers, each commanded by a
Sergeant
.
The Chapter Masters owe their allegiance to the Emperor. Ultimately, the Chapter is subject to the orders of the highest-ranking among the
Adeptus Terra
, although only in a general sense.
Chapters are monastic communities in nature; for most of the Marines, the Chapter is their world, and the only contact they have with outsiders is in battle.
Tactical Organisation
Main article:
Codex Astartes
The traditional Codex Chapter is tactically organised into a number of different types of squad.
Battleline Squads
include:
Tactical Squad
Primaris
Intercessor Squads
Close Support Squads
include:
Assault Squads
Inceptor Squads
Reiver Squads
Fire Support Squads
include:
Devastator Squads
Desolation Squads
Hellblaster Squads
Eradicator Squads
, or
Aggressor Squads
The squad types are equipped and trained to fulfil a specific battlefield role, each of the three types designed to complement each other on the battlefield to make a far more effective whole. In addition to these three squad types, veterans can be formed into
Veteran
or
Terminator Squads
, while the initiate Marines are formed into
Scout
squads.
Terminator squads are drawn from the entire chapter's best and most experienced warriors. The veterans wear the uniquely powerful
Terminator Armour
. These squads are formed when circumstances necessitate the concentration of the Chapter's most capable warriors and potent equipment into one or more heavily-armed and powerful units.
Ranks
Space Marine heraldry as per the
Codex Astartes
All Space Marine Chapters loosely utilise the same types of ranks. Many non-
Codex Astartes
chapters, however, will often use different names for these positions.
Chapter Master
— The highest attainable rank of Space Marine, commanding their entire Chapter.
Some Chapters, like the
Iron Hands
, do not maintain a Chapter Master.
Captain
— The second highest rank of a Chapter, they command a
Company
or its equivalent. Many Captains are given an honorific
Master
title.
Lieutenant
— These serve as the right hand to their Company Captain, typically commanding one of the Company's two demi-companies.
Sergeant
— Command Squads within each Company. Sergeants within the Chapter's 1st Company are known as
Veteran Sergeants
.
Battle-Brother
— Standard Space Marine rank for a fully inducted warrior. May include honorific duties such as
Honour Guard
,
Company Champion
, or
Standard Bearer
. The most experienced Battle-Brothers serve in the Chapter's 1st Company as
Veteran Space Marines
, who may wear ancient
Terminator
armor.
Vanguard Space Marine
- Covert-operation experts typically drawn from the 10th
Scout
Company. A Chapter will normally maintain 100 of these specialists.
Neophyte
— Space Marines in training who have not become fully accepted Battle-Brothers. They are utilised in a Chapter's
Scout
Squads as a part of their training.
Aspirant
—
Humans
selected to be inducted into a Chapter and undergo genetic modification.

Chapter cult
Main article:
Chapter Cult
As part of a Chapter, space marines are also members of its Chapter cult - a body of beliefs and practices integral to every single Space Marine Chapter.
Each cult is typically ministered by an inner priesthood of
Chaplains
.
Equipment
A
Firstborn
Space Marine of the
Ultramarines
Main article:
Space Marine Armoury
The primary individual weapons of the Space Marines is the
boltgun
and its pistol variant, the
bolt pistol
.
The distinctive
Power Armour
is worn by all Marines in battle. Some members of the Chapter's first company may instead be armoured in the heavier
Terminator Armour
.
Carapace armour
is worn by
Scouts
instead of power armour. There is also a fourth type of armour called
Artificer armour
, worn by most Marines who have served three centuries for the Emperor or performed a notably brave action in battle.
Each Space Marines Chapters has its own distinguished colour scheme. Unlike the
Astra Militarum
, Space Marines do not typically use camouflage because Adeptus Astartes combat doctrine does not incorporate concealment in battle. Bright and bold colour schemes lower enemy morale, announcing the arriving of the noble Chapter to the battlefield. The exceptions to the main colours may still exist for some of the Chapter's Companies - for example
Deathwing
company of the
Dark Angels
Chapter use white colour scheme and the
Ravenwing
— black.
In the same time Chapter's vehicles may be painted in different colours until the large bands of areas painted in the Chapter colours.
Recruitment and Training
Main article:
Creation of a Space Marine
Space Marines in battle
Recruits are chosen from the best warriors among
humanity
. Naturally, this makes
Feral Worlds
prized recruitment grounds, as such harsh and primal conditions produce the best warriors. However,
Hive Worlds
are considered the ideal source of potential recruits, the populace of the lower levels composed of some of the most murderous scum in the human Imperium. Whole gangs of hive scum are sometimes hunted down and captured for recruitment. Among the most valued traits in a recruit are aggression and psychotic-level killer instinct. Much more rarely, certain
Civilised Worlds
are also recruited from.
The potential recruit is first subjected to testing, including tissue compatibility tests and psychological screening. Relatively few get past this initial selection process. Those that do pass are termed "neophytes", and the process continues with the surgery, indoctrination, conditioning, and training that will make them Marines.
The surgical process takes a great deal of time. The recruit receives implants, along with chemical- and hypnotherapy, and training necessary for allowing the functioning and development of the implanted organs. The implants transform their bodies and minds and give them inhuman abilities - making them capable of spitting acidic venom, absorbing the memories of the dead by eating their flesh, raising them to heights of up to three metres tall
, darkening their skin to protect it from radiation, and operating for long periods without sleep by switching off parts of their brains at a time. After this implantation process and the associated training, the recruit becomes an "initiate".
Intense indoctrination and conditioning strengthens the recruit's resolve and increases mental capabilities, honing them into dedicated and merciless warriors. After more general training, they join the Chapter as full "brothers".
Biology
Space Marines are men in the same way a knife is a piece of metal. Space Marines are forged, not born. They are the finest weapons of the Emperor's will.

Main article:
Creation of a Space Marine#Implants
The many implants and abilities of a
Firstborn
Space Marine
Space Marines represent the pinnacle of Imperial bio-engineering. They are larger, stronger, faster
, and more durable than average humans. Most also display higher cognitive abilities, such as very accurate powers of recollection and a capacity to process information within mere nanoseconds.
Space Marines have frightening strength, which when augmented by power armour allows them to act as living battering rams capable of smashing through fast-moving light vehicles or crush human heads into pulp.
Space Marines also display superior vision, hearing, smell, sun/radiation resistance, and taste than standard humans. They have far greater resistances to heat and cold and can even survive for a time in the vacuum of space.
Space Marines are extremely durable, capable of eventually regenerating from wounds that would quickly kill a normal human, require little sleep, and are further enhanced with an additional
Black Carapace
armored skeleton as the final stage of their implantation process.
The strength and endurance of
Primaris Space Marines
is even greater than those of
Firstborn
.
Fully armoured, a Space Marine typically stands 2.1 meters (6'8") to 3.0 meters
(9’10") tall and weighs 500-1,000 kilograms (1,100-2,200lbs). Due to the nature of the zygotes that make up Astartes
Gene-Seed
, all Space Marines are male.
Space Marines live far longer than average humans.
Dante
, one of if not the oldest active currently known non-
Dreadnought
Space Marines, is currently over 1,100 years old.
A member of the
Salamanders
from the days of the
Great Crusade
,
Gravius
, later became stranded in space and was not rediscovered for some 10,000 years. The Marine was still alive in an inactive state, though withered and frail to the point of warranting being given a merciful death upon rediscovery.
Some Space Marines may initially believe their memory to be eidetic, but even their most glorious memories as an Astartes might be forgotten over the centuries.
This all lends to the theory that Space Marines while subject to gradual aging are "functionally immortal", though since they all inevitably die in battle one day there is not enough sufficient data to come to any firm conclusions.
Besides their base augmentations to strength, speed, endurance, etc. Space Marines also display a number of remarkable abilities due to their many implants and genetic engineering. These are outlined in detail in the
Creation of a Space Marine
article but most infamously include:
A secondary heart and additional lung
A far more robust digestive system and greater tolerance to poisons
An ability to spit acid
An ability to learn the memories of an organic lifeform by consuming their brain matter
An ability to enter a state of suspended animation as a means of staying alive while grievously wounded or isolated for potentially years after.
Daily Routine
Main article:
Daily rituals of a Space Marine
Space Marines have very organised daily routines including combat training, prayer, and indoctrination sessions with very little free time. This lends itself well to the disciplined and monastic nature of the Space Marines.
In Society
The average Imperial citizen often views the Astartes as gods-among-men, being subjects of myth and legend.
Alongside this, the
Ministorum
venerates them as the God-Emperor's descendants and greatest heroes who birthed the Imperium.
It is a grave religious taboo to even touch a weapon meant for the God-Emperor's Angels of Death.
The common person might be taught the names of the greatest Space Marine heroes and their greatest deeds, as they are retold from millions of pulpits across the entire Imperium.
Very few mortals will ever see a Space Marine, as their numbers are trivial compared to the seething mass of humanity. The best chance an average human will have to see one will be if cataclysmic forces threatening the greater Imperium comes to their world, or if they are part of similar Imperial forces sent to fight in such catastrophic wars. The subsequent chances of then conversing with an Astartes during such engagements are equally minute. A common human who does interact with even the lowliest of Battle-Brothers are likely to be awestruck in the extreme, unable to speak and forgetting themselves. They will typically be held in high regard and shown great deference, even the highest-ranking of officials bowing their heads in respect.
However, the reaction of extreme abasement and divine awe isn't universal to every human. Those who engage with Astartes with some degree of regularity, whether it be a
Chapter Serf
, military commander or
Inquisitor
, will grow accustomed to the presence and mannerisms of these transhuman brotherhoods. Demographics above or on the peripherals of Imperial society, such as
nobles
or
hive scum
, or others who largely disregard the frippery of Imperial propaganda might see the Astartes for what they are, tools of war. Some might not offer them any more fear or respect than that due to an expert soldier with a well-crafted weapon.
Behaviour
Space Marines are insular and live in a world of martial prowess where loyalty to the Chapter and bravery in battle are revered above all things. If any might find common ground with an Astartes, it will be those who excel at the art of war.
The manner in which a Space Marine interacts with common Humanity varies wildly from chapter to chapter, as well as might be influenced by their Chapter's Legion of lineage. Most are aloof and entirely focused on their own mission, setting themselves and their goals apart from ordinary people. Most tend to only see other Space Marines as equals to themselves. The standards of a Space Marine tend to be so high that only heroes of legend might be counted amongst their friends, beyond the bounds of Adeptus Astartes ranks.
A standard human must prove themselves worthy of an Astartes' notice, typically through skill-at-war or something related. In some exceedingly rare occassions, a human might earn the notice of a Space Marine. Some Space Marines might even offer aid or support in situations outside of active combat, such as offering a valuable peice of knowledge to aid in training, or other specialist knowledge the individual Space Marine might have to aid those they will likely be fighting alongside. However, even this will likely be delivered in their blunt and reserved inhuman way, at least to some degree.
The interpersonal skills of most Space Marines are significantly blunted or completely atrophied, in regards to communication with baseline humans. The processes that transformed them into transhuman warriors results in a brain no longer well suited for the nuance of human communication. For the vast majority of Astartes, they observe the niceties of baseline communication like an giant, exceptionally deadly child. This fact strains most interactions between them and baseline human associates. However, there are some Space Marines who prove to be an exception to this rule. Some Astartes never truly forgot what being a mortal human was like - such as the
Space Wolves
- or have taken time to relearn it.

Development History
The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an
in-universe
point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found
here
.
1985's LE2 Space Marine limited edition model
Space Marines have their origins in Games Workshops 1985's LE2 (Limited Edition 2) single character miniature alongside a
Space Orc
which predated even the release of the
1st Edition
by two years.
The Space Marines were subsequently one of the original factions for 1987's
Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader
alongside the
Imperial Army
,
Eldar
,
Orks
, and
Tyranids
.
During the
1st Edition
, they were described as 1000 independent Chapters collectively dubbed the
Legiones Astartes
.
Twelve Chapters were named in the original Rogue Trader rulebook: the
Dark Angels
,
Flesh Tearers
,
Flesh Eaters
,
Space Wolves
,
Ultramarines
,
White Scars
,
Blood Angels
,
Blood Drinkers
,
Crimson Fists
,
Iron Hands
,
Rainbow Warriors
, and
Silver Skulls
.
During the earliest days of
Warhammer 40,000
, the Space Marines were depicted as brutal, hyper-violent, and ideologically deluded.
Moreover, the concepts of founding
Legions
and
Primarchs
did not yet exist, and many Chapters had radically different lore. For instance, the Ultramarines were said to have been established in the
Third Founding
in
M32
in
White Dwarf 97
.
1990's
Realm of Chaos: The Lost and the Damned
established the concept of the twenty Founding Legions, Primarchs, and
Chaos Space Marines
as well as containing the first concrete description of the
Horus Heresy
. The
2nd
and
3rd
Editions and later the
Index Astartes
articles of the early 2000s firmly established the modern idea of Space Marine lore and army makeup.
Space Marine lore largely remained static from the early 2000s until the end of
7th Edition
in 2017. During the
Gathering Storm
series of campaign books, larger and newer
Primaris Space Marines
were introduced
while prior Space Marines were designated
Firstborn
.
