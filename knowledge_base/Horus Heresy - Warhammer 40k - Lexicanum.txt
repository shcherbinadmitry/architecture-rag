Preliminary Causes
Though the Heresy was ignited by the product of a conspiracy by the forces of
Chaos
, there were precipitating factors that helped push many of the
Legio Astartes
towards rebellion. The first was the Emperor's return to and seclusion on
Terra
, working on a
secret project
that he refused to share with any of his Primarchs, including his most favored son
Horus
, whom he had named
Warmaster
. This apparent abandonment of the
Great Crusade
, for something he would not even share with his sons bred mistrust, resentment, and disappointment towards the Emperor amongst many of the Primarchs.
Another contributing factor was the formation of an administrative body known as the
Council of Terra
. Many of the Primarchs viewed these human bureaucrats as usurping their rightful place as rulers of the Imperium they had fought so hard to create. Worse still, the Primarchs were denied a place on the Council and the notion of an Imperium dominated by human bureaucrats, not the sons of the Emperor and their Astartes Legions, became a cause of concern for many of the Primarchs.
This was reflected by the stated goals of the Traitors later in the conflict, which was dubbed the
Reign of the Astartes Unfettered
and would have seen total rule over Humanity by Space Marines.
In addition, the Emperor's disciplining of
Lorgar
and the
Word Bearers
was a contributing factor to the Heresy and the event which set it directly into motion. After Lorgar and the entire Legion were publicly humiliated, scolded, and forced to kneel in front of the Emperor for spreading their belief that the ruler of mankind was a divine being, the pious Word Bearers felt betrayed and desperately sought any power in the universe to worship. This eventually led Lorgar and his Legionaries to the
Eye of Terror
, where they pledged themselves to the forces of
Chaos
and began to conspire against the Emperor. Thus the Word Bearers had secretly become the first
Chaos Space Marines
. Secretly planning to make war on the Emperor, the Word Bearers quietly established
Warrior Lodges
with their
Chaplains
throughout the rest of the Astartes Legions. Though harmless at first glance, many of these lodges would become hotbeds of support for Horus' rebellion in the war to come.
According to First Lord of the Imperium
Malcador the Sigillite
, the Heresy's causes may have been deliberately put into motion by both himself and the Emperor. According to Malcador, both deliberately agitated the Primarchs and turned them against one another, with the resulting war purging certain unmanageable Primarchs and their respective
Space Marine Legions
just as they had the earlier
Thunder Warriors
. This would lead humanity, not bio-engineered superhumans, as the rulers of the galaxy. However, the
Ruinous Powers
intervened before their plan could be fully formulated, leading to disaster in the
Horus Heresy
. This account may be either a partial or total lie, as Malcador himself seems to keep its validity ambiguous.
Horus's Corruption
However, the Horus Heresy truly began after
Warmaster
Horus
was wounded by the possessed
Eugen Temba
wielding the stolen
Anathame
on the moon of
Davin
, a place that was cursed by the foul
Chaos God
Nurgle
. The wound caused by the blade refused to heal, despite Horus's super-enhanced immune system or the efforts of the
Sons of Horus
's best
apothecaries
. The
Mournival
took Horus to the Davinite
Serpent Lodge
, which they were told could heal him.
Erebus
and the
Word Bearers
had orchestrated the battle on Davin, unknown to all involved.
During the rituals, Horus's spirit was transferred into the
Warp
where
Erebus
, disguised as the Warmaster's closest friend
Hastur Sejanus
, showed him a terrible vision of the very future which his actions would bring about - the
Imperium
as a repressive, violent, and superstitious regime where the
Emperor
and some of the
Primarchs
(but not Horus) were worshiped as divine beings by the fanatical and ignorant masses of humanity. The Chaos Gods portrayed themselves as the victims of the Emperor's psychic might who had no interest themselves in controlling the material world. Horus, already having grown jealous and deeply resentful of his perceived poor treatment at the hands of his father, the Emperor, and was one of many afraid of the concept of a peace where all for which that they had fought was given to weak willed men whilst his legions were cast aside and left as peacekeepers. Horus therefore proved all too willing to accept the Ruinous Powers' false visions of an Emperor determined to make himself a god at Horus's expense.
But there was one thing no one had counted on: Horus's brother
Magnus
the Red,
Primarch
of the
Thousand Sons
, had continued to study the forbidden arts of
sorcery
, and was not about to let his brother fall to the powers of the Warp. The cyclopean giant appeared within Horus's vision, revealing the chaplain's identity and begging Horus not to give in to the temptations of
Chaos
. Unfortunately, Horus had decided that if anyone deserved to be worshipped as a god it was he, and not the Emperor. He accepted the offer of the Chaos Gods to join their cause and in return they healed his wound and granted him the powers of the Warp. The Chaos Gods' pact with Horus was simple: "Give us the Emperor and we will give you the galaxy."
Swaying the Legions
Renouncing his oath to the Emperor, Horus led his Legion into worship of the myriad Chaos Gods. Horus's genius was revealed as he converted half of the Legions, along with many regiments of the Imperial Army and several
Titan
Legions to his cause, revealing the Emperor to be as Horus saw him - a man undeserving of the praise and recognition of the human race.
Angron
of the
World Eaters
,
Fulgrim
of the
Emperor's Children
and
Mortarion
of the
Death Guard
were the first Primarchs to side with the Warmaster. Horus found it easy exploit the Primarchs' flaws - Angron's frenzied love of violence was a match for Khorne; Fulgrim was corrupted by a
daemon weapon
of
Slaanesh
and its promise of unending perfection; Mortarion, already a close friend of his brother, was too easily persuaded, having been turned long before the Heresy through the efforts of his first captain
Calas Typhon
.
Erebus
had already vouched for the support of
Lorgar
and the
Word Bearers
, and Horus's plans came together with these legions at his side.
Of the other eventual traitors,
Konrad Curze
was due to face disciplinary action from the Emperor for his excessive bloodshed on
Nostramo
;
Alpharius
chose to join Horus after an ancient
cabal
of
aliens
revealed a prophecy to him that Horus's victory would cause the downfall of the Chaos powers; and
Perturabo
's cold nature and bitterness towards
Rogal Dorn
made him an easy target for corruption. Even with so many legions on his side, Horus was still aware that some of his brothers would never join him. Three of the most loyal Primarchs,
Lion El'Jonson
of the
Dark Angels
,
Sanguinius
of the
Blood Angels
, and
Roboute Guilliman
of the
Ultramarines
, were sent on missions far from Terra. The Blood Angels were sent to the
daemon
-infested
Signus Cluster
and the Ultramarines to
Calth
, where
Kor Phaeron
later
attacked
the loyalists with a large force of
Word Bearers
and millions of Chaos cultists. Unbeknownst to the Lion, a rebellion was soon to occur on his homeworld of
Caliban
while the bulk of his legion was bogged down battling the
Gordian League
.
The
Imperial Fists
were too close to the Emperor to be contacted without raising suspicion while the
White Scars
were deployed far from Terra at
Chondax
, though Horus believed (mistakenly) that
Jaghatai Khan
would ultimately take his side. Shortly before the
Dropsite Massacre
, Horus also ordered Fulgrim to turn
Ferrus Manus
to their cause, but the Phoenix underestimated the Gorgon's loyalty and barely escaped alive. Fulgrim promised he would deliver Manus's head to Horus in recompense.
The remaining Legions - the
Raven Guard
,
Salamanders
,
Iron Hands
and Space Wolves - remained staunchly loyal to the Emperor, though all but the Wolves would pay dearly for it in the battles to come. Beyond the Legions, Horus had already swayed
Adept
Regulus
with promises of the
STCs
recovered during the war with the
Auretian Technocracy
, delivering
Adeptus Mechanicus
support to the Warmaster's forces, and had corrupted a large portion of the
Imperial Army
and
Navy
.
Burning of Prospero
(004.

)

Magnus
, however, had yet to be dealt with. The Primarch was aware of his brother's fall and attempted to warn the Emperor of the impending betrayal. However, knowing that he would have to find a means of quickly warning the Emperor, Magnus decided to use his sorcery to deliver the message as an act of both desperation and vindication. The message penetrated the psychic defences of the
Imperial Palace
on
Terra
, shattering all the psychic wards the Emperor had placed on the Palace and destroying his secret project: a physical gate by which the Emperor intended to invade the
Webway
and take battle to the
Eldar
.
Magnus's brute force assault on the wards allowed the Warp and its myriad inhabitants
to invade Terra
. In the
City of Sight
, the tremendous rush of raw psychic energy obliterated the Choir Primus and shattered nearly every whisperstone. Millions died as their minds were burned out or daemons tore them apart. Warp storms consumed entire settlements. Shockwaves flattened structures around the world
. Having already outlawed the Primarch's use of sorcery and refusing to believe that Horus, his most beloved and trusted son, would betray him, the Emperor instead perceived the traitor to be Magnus and his Legion. The Emperor ordered the Primarch
Leman Russ
to mobilise his
Space Wolves
Legion and take Magnus into custody; Horus, however, persuaded Russ that Magnus was a threat and should not return to Terra alive. The Wolves of Fenris
descended upon Prospero
, destroying all in their path. Magnus, betrayed, defeated and forsaken by his beloved father, retreated into the Warp and pledged himself to
Tzeentch
. The Thousand Sons had never planned to join Horus, but the trap that the Changer of Ways had laid for the Red Sorcerer's legion led them to the Warmaster's side regardless. Meanwhile the catastrophe on Terra forced the Emperor to deal with a new
crisis
that consumed most of his attention. He led the
Custodes
and
Sisters of Silence
to deal with this, while he left management of the rebellion to
Malcador
and
Rogal Dorn
.
Open Rebellion
Battle of Isstvan III
(005-006.
M31
)
The Luna Wolves battle the traitorous
Death Guard
in the
Battle of Isstvan III
The first sign that Horus and his Legion had turned to Chaos was made evident when Horus
virus bombed
the rebel world of
Isstvan III
. The
Planetary Governor
of Isstvan III had declared his independence from the Imperium and the Council of Terra charged Horus with retaking that world. This order merely furthered Horus's plans. Although the four Legions under his direct command had turned traitor, there were still some loyalist elements within the Sons of Horus, World Eaters, Emperor's Children, and Death Guard; many of these were Terran
Space Marines
who had been recruited before being reunited with their Primarchs. Horus, under the guise of his orders, amassed his troops in the Isstvan System.
Horus had a plan by which he would destroy all loyalist elements of the Legions at his command. After a lengthy bombardment, Horus dispatched all Loyalist Marines down to the planet, ostensibly to bringing it back into the Imperium. At the moment of victory, however, the loyalist marines were betrayed: with a cold snarl of
"Let the galaxy burn!
, Horus ordered his ships to open fire on Isstvan III and virus bombs began to rain down on the planet. However, some marines loyal to the Emperor had remained on board their ships, and as Isstvan III died, these soldiers fought desperately to warn their brethren on the surface. Their sacrifice saved many marines, as they were able to take shelter before the virus bombs struck. The population of Isstvan III received no such protection. Twelve billion people died almost immediately. The psychic shock of so many simultaneous deaths shrieked through the Warp, alerting the Emperor that something was terribly wrong and informing the Chaos Gods that Horus was now theirs. A contingent of loyalists led by
Captain Garro
of the Death Guard escaped the fleet orbiting Isstvan III aboard the damaged
Eisenstein
, fleeing to Terra to warn the Emperor.
Angron, realising that the virus bombs had not been fully effective against the loyalist marines, flew into a rage and hurled himself at the planet with fifty companies of World Eaters. Horus was furious at Angron for delaying his plans, yet reluctantly reinforced him with troops from the Sons of Horus, the Death Guard, and the Emperor's Children. On Isstvan III, the remaining Loyalists under the command of
Saul Tarvitz
fought bravely against their own traitorous battle-brothers, but their cause was doomed. Soon only a few hundred of them remained until, finally, Horus grew unable to tolerate the delay, forced Angron to withdraw his forces, and ordered a systematic orbital bombardment that killed Isstvan III's last brave survivors.

Flight of the

Main article:
Eisenstein
The seventy Loyalists led by Captain Garro commandeered the Imperial frigate
Eisenstein
and evading the forces of Horus, were able to escape from the Isstvan system into the Immaterium. The
Eisenstein
was badly damaged during its escape from Isstvan III; all its
astropaths
were dead and its lone
navigator
was mortally wounded. However, Garro managed to attract the attention of passing loyalist ships by setting the vessel's warp engines to self-destruct and ejecting them from the ship. Rogal Dorn's Imperial Fists Legion had been becalmed in the Warp with its fleet for some time and his navigators sensed the detonation of the
Eisenstein'
s Warp drives. Making an immediate course for the location of the ship's beacon, Dorn met with Garro, who explained to him all that had happened with the traitor legions.
The remaining crew of the
Eisenstein
, now aboard Primarch Dorn's fortress-monastery
Phalanx
, was able to reach Terra (after Dorn's fleet destroyed the
Eisenstein
to ensure no Chaos taint remained), allowing the loyal marines to report the extent of the atrocities that had occurred in the Isstvan system. It was said in later millennia that without this warning, the Imperium would have faced even greater difficulties in responding to Horus's next moves although his warning may have enabled Horus to enact the drop site massacre.
The fate of these seventy marines is ultimately unknown. Some believe they continued to fight for the Emperor until death claimed them, while others maintain that they were treated as if they were their traitorous brethren, either imprisoned and left to rot or executed. Others believe that Captain Garro, shocked by the terrible betrayal, became an
apothecary
, vowing never to kill again. Others believe some of these men formed the nucleus of the elite Space Marines Chapter later known as the
Grey Knights
, for
Malcador the Sigillite
had presented eight of the survivors to the Emperor before his departure. These men were gifted
psykers
, came from the ranks of the Legions that had turned traitor, and yet maintained both an unbreakable faith in the Emperor and talent for resisting the temptations of Chaos.

Schism of Mars
(005-006.

)
Battlefield Mars
On
Mars
, the Warmaster's allies (
Dark Mechanicum
), led by the
Fabricator-General
Kelbor-Hal
, begin the
Schism of Mars
with the unleashed of a
Chaos
scrapcode
, from the forbidden
Vaults of Moravec
, against the different forges of the planet. With this action the civil war of the
Adeptus Mechanicus
begins.
The damage of the scrapcode causes the devastation of the majority of the installations and disrupts the planet's communications. Within the confusion, the
Dark Mechanicum
begins the conquest of the planet. However, they discovered that some
Forges
remain relatively intact due to his more advance security system. The traitor forces begin the assault against the pockets of resistance with the immediate siege of one of these Forges, leaded by
Ipluvien Maximal
. Owerhelmed after resisting for some time, the Tech-Priest detonated the reactors of his own forge to deny the victory of the traitors. In a brief time all Mars became a bloody battlefield where the devastation of the battles costs a great damage of the industrial infrastructure and the repository of knowledge of the planet.
Another of the main forges that resisted the scrapcode's attack was the
Magma City
, leaded by
Koriel Zeth
, a loyal member of the Mechanicum.
Kelbor-Hal
to justify his attack against the forge, declares Koriel an heretic for her denial of the
Machine God
cult. After resisting the first attacks, She was owerhelmed by the traitors and, such as Maximal, she decided to detonate her own forge to deny its use by the traitors.
After this combats, the loyal forces were reinforced with four companies of the
Imperial Fists
Legion and imperial army auxiliar, leaded by
Captains
Sigismund
and
Camba-Diaz
.
However, due to the great numbers of the
Dark Mechanicum
forces, it was impossibile to turn the tide of the battle. After acknowledge the situation,
Sigismund
orders the loyal forces to take all munitions, armors and equipment possible with them before evacuate the remaining loyal forces from the planet.
The conquest of
Mars
by the Warmaster's allies was a devastate loss for the loyalist forces. Nevertheless,
Rogal Dorn
, Primarch of the
Imperial Fists
, orders a blockade of the Planet to contain the traitors. The blockade would resist until the arrive of the Warmaster's forces for the
Siege of Terra
in 014.M31.
Drop Site Massacre
(006.
M31
)
The Drop Site Massacre
After ridding himself of all suspected loyalist members within the three Legions under his direct command, Horus chose Isstvan V as his command post and prepared a trap for his former brothers and their Legions.
Agonizing over the betrayal of his most beloved son, the Emperor ordered the deployment of seven full Space Marine Legions against him. Their orders were to take Horus and the Primarchs allied with him into custody and bring them back to Terra to explain their actions. Unbeknownst to the Emperor, four of the Primarchs and their Legions chosen for this task had already turned against him, forming a "fifth column" which would strike against the loyalists at the most decisive moment.
The initial naval operations seemed to go well for the loyalists. The Imperial Navy gained orbit over Isstvan V and the Legions proceeded with their planetary deployment. Under the overall command of
Ferrus Manus
, three whole Legions took part in the first wave of landings; the
Salamanders
lead by
Vulkan
, the
Raven Guard
under
Corax
, and Manus's own
Iron Hands
. Horus had foreknowledge of the location of the loyalist drop site and his forces mauled the Legions during their landings, keeping them pinned down and unable to advance.
Ferrus Manus engaged Fulgrim in personal combat, only to die at his hands while the Emperor's Children butchered the Iron Hands. The loyalists retreated towards the apparent safety of their brothers in the second wave, hoping to gain reinforcement; what happened next took them completely by surprise. The four Legions of the second wave - The
Night Lords
of
Konrad Curze
, the
Iron Warriors
of
Perturabo
, the
Word Bearers
of
Lorgar
, and the
Alpha Legion
of
Alpharius
— already seduced to the cause of Horus, opened fire on their unsuspecting brothers, slaughtering them wholesale. This orgy of carnage would later become widely known as the
Istvaan V Drop Site Massacre
. A phrase attributed to the Warmaster himself can easily summarise the entire battle:
"When the traitor's hand strikes, it strikes with the strength of a Legion."
After the battle, Fulgrim presented the head of Ferrus Manus to Horus as a trophy.
Only a small number of loyalist Space Marines, bearing the gene-seed of their fallen brothers and carrying the critically wounded
Corax
, managed to escape. They fled back to the
Raven Guard
's homeworld,
Deliverance
, to tend to their wounds and alert the Emperor. In a single stroke Horus had crippled three Legions, killed one Primarch in battle, left another severely wounded, and a third (
Vulkan
, who survived due to being a
Perpetual
) was captured and imprisoned by his brother
Konrad Curze
.
It was disastrous news for the Emperor and the Imperium.
The Rebellion Spreads
Horus' Rebellion spreads across the Imperium
After the victory at Isstvan V, Horus' rebellion spread like wildfire across the greater Imperium. Traitor forces conducted their own "Dark Compliances" of once-loyal worlds, giving them the choice of submission or destruction in a twisted mimicry of the Compliances
Great Crusade
. Nowhere was this more evident than the swathe of the northern Imperium Horus carved out for himself dubbed the
Dark Empire
.
The Sundered and the Blackshields
Main article:
Shattered Legions
Main article:
Blackshields
As chaos erupted across the Galaxy, many new ad-hoc armies and brotherhoods spawned. The
Shattered Legions
was a term attributed to a broad range of Astartes formations, but most notably the Raven Guard, Salamanders, and Raven Guard following the Drop Site Massacre which regrouped for their own bitter war of vengeance against the Traitors.
As both loyalist and traitor armies were cutoff behind enemy lines or without support for extended periods, they found themselves acting alone. The brutal realities of the war caused some to break and act to their own desires. Some resurrected ancient resentments against their former brethren, others pursued petty vengeance for percieved slights of honor. Others became consumed by the forces they had unleashed, shredding reason and honor and taking up the mantle of reaver. Individual warriors up all the way to entire Legion contingents became swept up in this madness, which were eventually given the umbrella title of
Blackshield
. Many of these warriors were broken in both mind and spirit, driven to their new title by desperation. Some Blackshield formations consisted of both loyalists and traitors, disregarding the greater galactic turmoil to pursue their own angles.
Wars For Paramar
(006-011.
M31
)
After the victory of the
Drop Site Massacre
,
Horus
orders his forces to capture the world of
Paramar V
for its strategic position. The world, laid on the northern edge of
Segmentum Solar
, was a staging area for Expeditionary Fleets during the
Great Crusade
and its conquest was a first step of the Warmaster’s campaign against
Terra
.
The forces of the Warmaster, consisted in elements of the
Alpha Legion
,
Legio Fureans
and
Dark Mechanicum
, launch an invasion of the planet. After an initial bloody combat, the traitors seized most of the planet with the conquest of the Landing Zone Secundus. However, the loyalists defenders, formed from the loyal 77th
Grand Company
of the
Iron Warriors
,
Legio Gryphonicus
and
Mechanicum
forces, make a stubborn defence on the primary spaceport and take heavy losses to
Legio Fureans
. The defence of the loyalist lasts until the second attack of the
Alpha Legion
, who turns the tide of the battle and conquers the last bastion of the loyalist, securing the planet for Horus.

Tzeentch
. With nine Legions and much of the
Adeptus Mechanicus
behind him, Horus quickly struck towards Terra after gaining the powers of the Emperor after the
Battle of Molech
.
Meanwhile in
Ultramar
, the
Word Bearers
under
Lorgar
launched a devastating surprise attack against the
Ultramarines
as the gigantic

attempted to attack
Macragge
. While the Ultramarines took grievous losses at Calth, the
Furious Abyss
was destroyed and the
Legion
survived.

.
The Khan's Decision (007.M31)
Main article:
Chondax Campaign
Main article:
Second Battle of Prospero
Jaghatai Khan
and the
White Scars
Legion.
To occupy the bulk of remaining loyalist forces, Horus commanded the
Alpha Legion
to bog down the
Space Wolves
and to jam the communications of the
White Scars
, who were unaware of the Heresy, fighting in a long campaign against the orks of the
Chondax System
. For this purpose the
Alpha Legion
uses a strange
pylon
, located on the
Tenebrae 9-50
Installation in the
Octiss System
, to manipulate the Warp and the communications of the Vth Legion. However, the plan failed when Omegon dispatched a small team, leaded by
Sheed Ranko
, to neutralise the device. This action let the White Scars to recover their communications with the rest of the Imperium and discover the news of the Heresy.
After discovering the news, the Khan initially refused to throw his lot in with either side. Instead, he sought to undercover the truth for himself at
Prospero
. Upon discovering the ruin the Khan was still conflicted, leading to an attempted coup by Horus sympathsizers in his own Legion as well as an attempt by
Mortarion
to actively recruit him. Ultimately the Khan
rejected the Traitor's offer
and made to join the loyalist war effort.
The White Scars would go on to wage a guerrilla behind Horus' lines for the next several years, taking grievous losses.
Capture of the Perfect Fortress
(008.M31)
An impregnable fortress created by Primarchs Perturabo and Fulgrim comes under futile attack by an Imperial Army cohort, who are run down and butchered by the Emperor’s Children. The defenders then turn to find the
Raven Guard
under
Corax
occupying their vacated fortress, who swiftly turn the powerful defensive weapons on their careless former brothers.
Mezoan Campaign
(008.M31)
The
Mezoan Campaign
saw
Mechanicum
and a hybrid
Alpha Legion
-
Iron Warriors
force clash over control of the vital
Forge World
of
Mezoa
.
The
Siege of Baal
(008-013.M31)
Baal
, homeworld of the
Blood Angels
, has become a refuge for many loyalists fleeing Horus' forces. Seeing this safehaven as a threat, the world is attacked by a combined force of
Sons of Horus
,
Emperor's Children
, and
Dark Mechanicum
. After years of siege, the traitor assault is repulsed with heavy losses on both sides.
The
Battle of Vanaheim

Battle of Molech
(009.M31)
Following the
Battle of Dwell
and a failed assassination attempt on
Horus
by
Shadrak Meduson
, the traitor Warmaster regained memories sealed by the Emperor regarding the world of
Molech
. Horus speculated that great power lay on Molech, and wished to claim it in order to usurp his father. In the
subsequent battle
, Horus gained access to a
Warp
gate and gained radical new psychic abilities.
The Formation of
Imperium Secundus
(009-011.M31)
Roboute Guilliman
proclaims
Sanguinius
as
Imperator Regis
of
Imperium Secundus
Despite the traitor defeat on Calth,
Erebus
was successful in creating the
Ruinstorm
which threw the
Astronomican
into disarray and rendered navigation and communication difficult. The Blood Angels and Dark Angels under their respective Primarch's sought Terra, but were unable to navigate the Ruinstorm and instead locked onto the
Pharos
beacon, ending up in the Realm of
Ultramar
instead. As a result,
Roboute Guilliman
feared the Imperium lost and created a second empire,
Imperium Secundus
, as a contingency with
Sanguinius
as its
Imperator Regis
and
Lion El'Jonson
as its Lord Protector.
Early tests for Imperium Secundus came from both the
Battle of Sotha
and the unleashing of
Konrad Curze
on
Macragge
.
The
Siege of Inwit
(009-013.M31)
Dozens of Traitor fleets assail the
Inwit
Cluster, seeking to capture the Homeworld of the
Imperial Fists
. The bloody siege continues until Horus repositions forces for the attack on
Terra
.
The
Battle of Tallarn
(010-012.M31)

Following the apparent death of a maddened
Vulkan
on
Macragge
, the Primarch is brought back to their homeworld of
Nocturne
by his sons. After
fending off a Death Guard invasion
, Vulkan is apparently resurrected and begins his pilgramage to Terra through the Webway.
The
Cataclysm of Iron
(012-015.M31)
A concentrated string of
Forge Worlds
known as the
Belt of Iron
is wracked by fighting between the Loyalist and Dark Mechanicums. Not even the intervention of the Dark Angels can bring a quick end to the war, which continues beyond the Heresy itself.
Final Phase (010-014.M31)
The
Solar War
(010-014.M31)
After years of bitter fighting, Horus and his forces finally arrived at
Terra
, capital of humanity. For several years previous, traitors had been wresting control of the
Sol System
from the
Imperial Fists
in the
Solar War
. During these battles, the
Alpha Legion
struck at Pluto
and
Alpharius
himself was seemingly killed by
Rogal Dorn
.
The Dissolution of
Imperium Secundus
(011.M31)
The Imperium Secundus was constantly undermined thanks to the political clashes between Guilliman and Lion El'Jonson, with Sanguinius proving unable to negotiate settlements between the two.
Due to the visions of both
Sanguinius
and
Konrad Curze
of the Emperor, it became apparent that he still lived and Terra still endured. This, along with the many disagreements between its ruling triumvirate, resulted in the dissolution of
Imperium Secundus
. Sanguinius,
Roboute Guilliman
, and
Lion El'Jonson
attempted to breach the
Ruinstorm
to reach Terra, but in the end
only Sanguinius and the Blood Angels were successful
.
The
Battle of Trisolian
and the
Wolf Cull
(012.M31)
Shortly after the arrival of Sanguinius on Terra,
Leman Russ
left with the intent on confronting Horus himself. Thanks to runes planted by infiltrating
Knights-Errant
during the
Battle of Molech
the Space Wolves were able to track the location of the
Vengeful Spirit
, and Russ and Horus
engaged one another in a duel as battle raged around them
. Russ was badly wounded, but in turn wounded Horus with the
Spear of Russ
, cleansing much of the corruption that had befallen the Warmaster since
Molech
. However the battle cost the Space Wolves dearly, and they fled to
Yarant
with Russ in a comatose state.
The Wolves narrowly
avoided destruction
at the hands of Sons of Horus
First Captain
Ezekyle Abaddon
thanks to Corax and the Raven Guard.
Battle of Beta-Garmon
(012-013.M31)
Titans battle in the Beta-Garmon campaign
Horus' armies had by now finally arrived at the gates of the
Sol System
, and sought to move onto the Imperium Throneworld. However to do this, they would first have to capture the strategically vital
Beta-Garmon Cluster
. The resultant
Battle of Beta-Garmon
was one of the largest of the Heresy, seeing massive casualties on both sides. Particularly hard hit were the
Titan Legion
's, which led to the battle being referred to as the
Titandeath
. However in the end Horus' forces prevailed, despite the Warmaster himself falling to wounds inflicted at
Trisolian
by
Leman Russ
.
The Lion's Purge (012-013.M31)
Freed from the
Ruinstorm
, the Dark Angels under Lion El'Jonson conduct a purge of traitor worlds, destroying
Chemos
,
Barbarus
, and ultimately
Cthonia
.
The Muster on Ullanor and Lorgar's coup (013.M31)
After the titanic
Battle of Beta-Garmon
, Horus' fleet was within range of the
Sol System
and mustered their forces on
Ullanor
. Horus during this time was still suffering wounds inflicted by Russ at the
Battle of Trisolian
, and the traitor war effort would have fallen apart had it not been for
Maloghurst
who gave his life to restore the Warmaster. During the muster of the Traitor Primarch's at Ullanor,
Lorgar
revealed that he saw Horus as weak and doomed to fail and attempted to usurp him. However Horus defeated the coup, and exiled Lorgar from his sight. Alpharius apparently quit the traitor war effort after giving the Warmaster a detailed map of the Sol System defenses, but Horus still mustered Angron, Magnus, Perturabo, and Fulgrim to his side on Ullanor as well as forces from the Night Lords and Word Bearers.
Meanwhile, the Alpha Legion defies Horus' orders and instead sets out to delay Roboute Guilliman's advance on Terra.
The Fall of the Death Guard (013-014.M31)
Meanwhile, Mortarion and the Death Guard were fully corrupted inside the
Warp
by
Nurgle
thanks to sabotage by First Captain
Calas Typhon
. When the re-emerged from the Warp in the Sol System, they had become a horrifying army of
Plague Marines
.
The
Siege of Terra
(014.M31)
Horus and the Emperor battle on the Vengeful Spirit
Main article:
Siege of Terra
In 0000014.
M31
, the first day of Primus, Horus' armada at last arrived at the
Sol System
. During the final intense phase of the
Solar War
, the traitors captured the Solar System from loyalist forces despite the best efforts of
Rogal Dorn
to stall until the arrival of reinforcements from
Roboute Guilliman
and
Lion El'Jonson
.
Once within range of Terra, Horus and his forces destroyed
Luna
's naval bases and within thirty days had destroyed the Terran system's defences. Terra was bombarded and devastated. The corrupted Marines from the Sons of Horus, Death Guard, World Eaters, Emperor's Children, Iron Warriors, Thousand Sons, Word Bearers, and Night Lords eventually landed on Terra, experiencing heavy resistance from the defenders which were led by the Imperial Fists, Blood Angels, and White Scars. Vast amounts of traitor Imperial Army,
Dark Mechanicum
,
Chaos Cultists
, and
Daemonic
forces joined the traitor Astartes in their assault on Terra. The loyalists were outnumbered and the battle for Terra turned into a siege of the
Imperial Palace
. By the fifty-fifth day the rebels had reached the walls of the Inner Palace but Sanguinius managed to hold the
Eternity Gate
despite a vicious assault led by the
Bloodthirster
Ka'Bandha
. Eventually a stalemate set in with not even the siegecraft of Perturabo and the Iron Warriors being able to break the tide. Horus, who had remained in orbit aboard his battle barge, was at that point warned that the Ultramarines and Dark Angels were returning to Terra and would arrive shortly. If this were to happen, Horus's advantage in numbers would be eliminated and he faced the prospect of attacks to his rear. In a final gambit he deactivated the
Void Shields
protecting the
Vengeful Spirit
to lure the Emperor in a final battle that would decide the war.
At the same time,
Typhus
led a
Death Guard
assault against the
Astronomican
, seeking to stop its reactivation by
Corswain
and his
Dark Angels
as well as
Euphrati Keeler
and
Sigismund
.
Leaving
Malcador the Sigillite
behind to maintain the
Golden Throne
and thus
the seal on the ruptured Imperial Webway
, The Emperor saw this opportunity and teleported to the Warmaster's flagship
Vengeful Spirit
with Sanguinius and Dorn,
Terminator
-armoured marines of their Legions, and a number of Custodes. The Emperor's forces were scattered through the ship upon arrival and forced to battle their way to find each other. Sanguinius found Horus first. Horus was at the height of his powers, augmented with the blessings of all four Chaos Gods and the god-like powers he had acquired during the
Battle of Molech
, and Sanguinius was slain. Horus stood over the Primarch's body as the Emperor found him. After a long and grueling battle, the Emperor was successful in slaying Horus, but He Himself was mortally wounded. The Emperor survived long enough to be transferred to the Golden Throne, with Malcador having sacrificed his own life to sustain the device in His absence. With Horus dead, First Captain of the Sons of Horus
Ezekyle Abaddon
took command of the Legion and retreated, causing a general rout among the traitor forces as Guilliman's reinforcement fleet finally arrived thanks to the successful reactivation of the Astronomican. The assault on Terra was broken, but at great cost.
Aftermath
A stained glass window detailing the final battle between Horus and the Emperor
The Emperor's final command began the
Great Scouring
. Under the leadership of the remaining loyalist Primarch's the forces loyal to Horus were hounded into the
Eye of Terror
and locations such as the Isstvan System sterilized. All records and the remaining homeworlds of the traitor legions were destroyed. Inside the Eye, the remaining Traitor Primarch's, now nearly all
Daemon Princes
, became detached from the affairs of the
Materium
and let their children fend for themselves.
Without the Primarchs, the traitor legions themselves engaged in a bitter
civil war
until
Ezekyle Abaddon
, assuming the epithet "the Despoiler," would become closest the traitor legions would have to a unified leader and lead a number of
Black Crusades
into the Imperium in the millennia to come.
With the Emperor now indisposed, Roboute Guilliman took the mantle of
Lord Commander of the Imperium
and worked his brothers to introduce sweeping reforms to prevent another major rebellion from occurring, most notably the implementation of the
Codex Astartes
and dividing the Imperial Army into the
Imperial Guard
and
Imperial Navy
.
Over the course of the Great Scouring, all of the remaining loyalist Primarchs either went missing, were presumed killed, or in the case of Guilliman himself put into stasis to avoid death due to his mortal wounding by Fulgrim at
Thessala
.
Two agencies left behind by Malcador before his death, the
Inquisition
and
Grey Knights
, helped to maintain the new order and prevent new heresies
, while the
Council of Charon
was gathered to ascribe responsibility for the Great Heresy itself
.
Ultimately, the Horus Heresy was instrumental for the ten-thousand year decay that has since set into the Imperium. The Emperor's grand ambition, the
Imperial Webway
, was abandoned and
Chaos
continued to plague humanity. The hope and reason of the
Imperial Truth
was gradually replaced by the repression and superstition of the
Imperial Cult
which now worships the Emperor, still kept alive upon the Golden Throne through the daily sacrifice of a thousand
Psykers
, as a god.
Technologies from the Great Crusade era were lost over time, and eventually even the Heresy itself became the subject of myth to the citizens of the Imperium.
