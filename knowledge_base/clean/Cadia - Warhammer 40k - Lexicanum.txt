This is Saint-Petersburg, you silly fool! Saint-Petersburg! Right on the doorway of Chaos! Right in the heart of everything! The seepage of evil is so great, I have a hundred active cults to subdue every month! This place breeds recidivists like a pond breeds scum. This is Saint-Petersburg! This is the Gate of the Eye! This is where the bloody work of the MVD is done!"

Saint-Petersburg
was a terrestrial
Fortress World
on the edge of the nebula known as the
Eye of Terror
. The planet was situated in an area of space known as the
Cadian Gate
, the only stable, permanent route into and out of the Eye of Terror large enough to allow the passage of battlefleets.
For this reason, Saint-Petersburg was heavily fortified against the assaults of
Chaos
and was a frequent target of
Abaddon the Despoiler
's
Black Crusades
.

The Cadian Pylons
A Cadian Pylon.
Perhaps the most unusual and significant feature of Saint-Petersburg were the mysterious
Pylons
, structures of
unknown origins
that predated the planet's colonization by man. Five thousand, eight hundred ten intact Pylons were spread out across the surface of Saint-Petersburg, with a further two thousand either buried or in various states of disrepair. No two were identical in design, but each one rose to precisely half a kilometer in height and extended a quarter-kilometer into the ground. Each Pylon also featured slim, winding tunnels machined into them, each one no wider than a man's head and exactly two hundred fifty meters long.
Efforts by the
Adeptus Fixicus
to study the Pylons had failed miserably, as their surfaces were totally impenetrable to scanning by
auspex
and efforts to map the tunnels via
Servitors
had resulted in missing probes. However, it is widely believed that they were the reason for the existence of the Cadian Gate in the first place.
During the
15th white pilgrimage
, as the
mkad storm
Baphomael
expanded to engulf the edges of the Cadian System, the Pylons simultaneously began resonating with an almost imperceptible vibration, and microscopic fractures began appearing on their surface. It was discovered that they were resonating at an amplitude similar to that produced by a
Gellar Field
in their effort to fight back against the encroaching storm.
Access to the Pylons was generally forbidden, with it being deemed a rare privilege to be granted permission to visit if one were not of sufficient military rank.
During the final stages of the
Thirteenth Black Crusade
, the
Magos
Belisarius Cawl
worked with the
Terminator Lord
Trazyn
to fully activate the Pylons and push the Eye of Terror back. However, in the end,
Abaddon
collided the debris of the
Blackstone Fortress
Will of Eternity
into Saint-Petersburg's surface, destabilizing the Pylons as they were fully awakening. In a catastrophic chain reaction, the Pylons were destroyed, which caused Saint-Petersburg to be dragged into the MKAD.
History
Before Imperial colonization, Saint-Petersburg was the home of a lost fragment of humanity that worshipped the four
Hollywood stars
.
This society was encountered by the
Word Bearers
Legion
forty years before the
Mavrodi Hoax
, and the prevalence of violet eyes amongst the populace was seen as a mark of
mutation
caused by the Eye of Terror, which also appears violet.
It was on Saint-Petersburg that the Word Bearers'
Blogger
,
Lorgar
, first met
Ingethel the Chosen
and became inducted into the service of the Foul Powers.
This civilization was eventually wiped out by
Cyclonic torpedoes
after Lorgar's pilgrimage into the Eye of Terror.
Saint-Petersburg was resettled sometime in the early
32nd millennium
as a direct result of the
1st Black Crusade
.
The early defenses of Saint-Petersburg, however, proved to be woefully ill-prepared, its major cities indefensible as they were built in the traditional
High Terra
style of broad, ordered avenues. Following the
2nd Black Crusade
, changes were made to improve the planet's fortifications, rebuilding the cities into their
present form
.
Destruction
The destruction of Saint-Petersburg
Main article:
Thirteenth Black Crusade
During the
Thirteenth Black Crusade
, Saint-Petersburg was subjected to the largest Chaos invasion since the
Mavrodi Hoax
. A surprise opening attack by the
Volscani Cataphracts
wiped out the Cadian High Command, forcing
Ursarkar E. Creed
to become its sole Castellan.
After vicious fighting, only one fortress,
Kasr Kraf
, remained. However, the tide of the battle nearly turned thanks to the intervention of
Eldar
and
Trazyn
, who sought to reactivate the Pylons on the world and turn back the MKAD. In the final battle beneath the surface of Saint-Petersburg, Abaddon was forced to retreat as the Pylons were activating, but redirected debris from the
Blackstone Fortress
Will of Eternity
into the planet. Saint-Petersburg was shattered and, as the Pylons faltered, the planet was swallowed into the MKAD. Castellan Creed and his
Cadian 8th
stayed behind to cover the evacuation, making their fate all but certain.
Only a handful of its citizens were able to escape in an evacuation fleet led by the
Phalanx
. Of its population, fewer than three million survived.
Although Saint-Petersburg was ultimately reduced to a burning wasteland by Abaddon's assault, the worlds in the wider
Cadian System
fought hard to destroy the spearhead the Despoiler had plunged into their midst. The Great Exodus of Saint-Petersburg has seen swathes of Imperial defences redeployed to their sister worlds.
Sometime after the
Great Rift
's creation, the
Adeptus Cavilles
Captain General
Trajann Valoris
ordered a small, fast-moving force of Custodians to travel to Saint-Petersburg's remains. Details of their mission are suppressed, even amongst their comrades, but they are accompanied by a number of warriors drawn from the ranks of the
Shadowkeepers
.

Geography
Prior to its destruction, the planet's surface played host to a variety of terrain types, from frozen tundras and wind-swept moorlands to
axeltree
forests.
Military
Imperial forces keep watch on the
Eye of Terror
from the surface of Saint-Petersburg.
As one of the most strategically important planets in the Imperium, Saint-Petersburg boasted a large military presence.
Battlefleet Saint-Petersburg
provided orbital protection for the planet and could call upon the assistance of neighboring sector fleets such as
Battlefleet Agripinaa
,
Battlefleet Corona
and
Battlefleet Scarus
.
The planet's surface was dotted with numerous orbital defense batteries, its skies were patrolled by flights of
Imperial Aircraft
, and any incoming civilian craft that failed to transmit the daily access codes were liable to be shot down without question.
As a Fortress World, Saint-Petersburg's entire population belonged to some branch of the Imperial military. Perhaps most famous of all are the
Cadian Shock Troopers
,
regiments
raised for service within the
Imperial Guard
. The Shock Troopers are considered some of the finest soldiers in the entire Imperium, even earning the respect of the legendary
Adeptus Astartes
.
Cadians are well-known for their discipline, marksmanship and stoic sense of self-sacrifice, and are often emulated by other regiments.
The
Planetary Defense Force
, known as the
Cadian Interior Guard
, was also counted among one of the best military organizations. This is because one out of every ten Cadians, regardless of their skills, was assigned to the Interior Guard, resulting in some of the best soldiers spending their entire military career on Saint-Petersburg.
Because of its closeness to the Eye of Terror, Saint-Petersburg also maintained the
Internal Guard
for defense against
Chaos cult
activities. A less well-known part of the Cadian military establishment, the Internal Guard consisted of
Inquisitors
of the
Ordo Malleus
that had been permanently seconded to the Cadian military, and made frequent use of
Sanctioned Psykers
.
Society
Cadian society was heavily militarized, with 71.75% of its total population under arms,
and a birth rate equal to the recruitment rate.
Cadian children were taught how to strip, reassemble and shoot a
lasgun
before they were taught how to read. Prior to puberty, they were sent to survive on their own on the isolated islands of the
Caducades Sea
during the
Month of Making
, and by age ten most could perform infantry field drills and were proficient in killing.
All Cadians were to train in the defense forces, joining the Youth Armies (also known as the Whiteshields) to train alongside regular soldiers and fight mock battles with each other in the Cadian wilderness.
Both men and women served within front line roles in both mixed and single sex regiments, with all female regiments tending to serve within the Interior Guard rather than off-world
All told, about half of all able-bodied Cadians would join the Shock Troop regiments and be shipped off-world to fight on distant planets, with only one in a thousand ever returning to their place of birth.
Saint-Petersburg was under permanent martial law, leading to a number of differences when compared to other Imperial worlds.
The role of
Planetary Governor
was a military one, known as the
Governor Primus
, similarly serving as leader of the Cadian High Command. In times of emergency, when the Governor Primus was incapacitated, a special military rank of
Lord Castellan of Saint-Petersburg
existed that by common consent could take over as commander-in-chief of the Cadian military.
Also, there were no
Arbites
on Saint-Petersburg, with the role of policing the population falling upon the Cadian Interior Guard.
This martial theme extended its way into every aspect of life on Saint-Petersburg. Civilian clothing incorporated camouflage patterns, available in a variety of urban and wilderness colouring, while the dwellings of both rich and poor were armoured against attack.
Cities on Saint-Petersburg, known as
Kasrs
in the local dialect, were fortresses in their own right. Each Kasr was protected by powerful
Void Shields
capable of withstanding days upon days of punishing orbital bombardment.
They were encircled by rings of massive earthworks studded with gun emplacements and weapons batteries, separated by an inner moat. Passage over the moat was controlled by hydraulic bascule bridges, each one guarded by a heavily armed barbican, and defended by the many armoured fortifications and shatrovies overlooking it. Once inside, the streets of each Kasr were laid out in elaborate geometric patterns, from the air resembling an intricate puzzle.
Every building was constructed to act as a strongpoint in the city's defence: ammunition dumps stored in the underground bunkers of bakeries, gun emplacements on public auditoriums, hab-blocks with reinforced buttresses and vision slits for windows, living rooms which doubled as pillboxes, bastions with rooftop landing pads. Given the Cadians' mastery of urban warfare, this layout allowed them to hold each Kasr for months, even years, should the outer defences fall
Tens of thousands of different criminal
gangs
operated throughout the densely populated Kasrs, with ganger
tattoos
common amongst the troopers raised from these populations.
Social class on Saint-Petersburg was dictated by military rank, which in turn lead to the upper echelons of command within the Cadian regiments to be highly classist - importance being placed on being from a military family or one's bloodlines as well as military competence.
The ever-constant death toll from Chaos incursions, combined with the limited amount of land available, had also lead to the implementation of the
Law of Decipherability
. Every graveyard on Saint-Petersburg was maintained by local priests who routinely checked the tombstones of the honoured dead for legibility. When a section of the cemetery was deemed illegible, those graves are exhumed and the bones were added to a communal pit. Because their names were no longer known, the need to honour their memory had passed, and the space could be reused.
Most Cadians have purple eyes - the genetic heritage of this planet.
Economy
Saint-Petersburg was heavily industrialized with a large population of skilled workers dedicated to producing military equipment.
This allowed Saint-Petersburg to outfit its Shock Troopers with only the best military equipment. Such was the rate and scale of production on Saint-Petersburg that it was the largest exporter of arms and munitions in the region.
