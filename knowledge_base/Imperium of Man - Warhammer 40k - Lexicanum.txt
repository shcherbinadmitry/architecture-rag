The
Imperium of Man
, also occasionally called the
Imperium of Mankind
and simply the
Imperium
, is the galactic empire under which the majority of
humanity
is united. The founder and nominal ruler of the Imperium is the god-like
Emperor of Mankind
, the most powerful human
psyker
ever known.
The Imperium is the largest and most powerful political entity in the
galaxy
.
An Imperial planet might be separated from its closest neighbour by hundreds or thousands of light years. As a stellar empire, the size of the Imperium cannot be measured in terms of contiguous territory, but only in the number of planetary systems in its control.
While it is commonly stated that the Imperium is an empire of a million worlds,
the Imperium controls countless worlds.
Some state between a million,
millions,
a billion
or even billions in total.
The overall number of planets has never been exactly determined, entire departments of the
Administratum
are devoted to cataloguing every controlled world, a task without end, due to the constantly changing nature of the domain. New planets are constantly discovered, conquered or colonised while old ones are lost.
The Imperium also controls untold millions of stars.
The Imperium rules a million worlds is a common saying heard across its citizenry. A million worlds sounds numerous and strong. A dominating force. Easily understood by the egos of men. In truth, the Imperium is spread out thinly across billions of worlds, individual motes scattered across the vastness of the galaxy. Vulnerable to its many perilous threats.
Several aliens and forces -
Chaos
,
Tyranids
,
Eldar
,
Dark Eldar
,
Orks
,
Tau
,
Necrons
- challenge the supremacy of the Imperium. From within, the Imperium is threatened more insidiously by rebellion,
mutation
, rogue
psykers
, and subversive
cults
. Without the protection of the Imperium, mankind would fall prey to the countless perils that threaten it.

History of the Imperium
Main article:
Age of the Imperium
The Imperium was founded by the Emperor, also called
The Immortal Emperor
,
God-Emperor
, and the
Master of Mankind
, at the end of the
Age of Strife
— a very long period of anarchy, war, and destructive regression which brought humanity to the brink of destruction and reversed the technological progression made during the
Dark Age of Technology
. In the
Unification Wars
, the Emperor led his proto-
Astartes
known as
Thunder Warriors
to victory in unifying Terra for the first time in millennia.
As the
Warp storms
of the Age of Strife subsided, after having secured the scientific posts and spacedocks of
Luna
, along with the factories and scientists on
Mars
, the Emperor began to unite mankind under his rule. A vast navy was built, with which his armies undertook the
Great Crusade
, which lasted for about two centuries. During this two hundred year-long military campaign, the Emperor employed his most potent military units, the
Space Marine Legions
, led by their leaders, the
Primarchs
. These, combined with the might of the
Imperial Army
(which was later separated into the
Imperial Guard
and the
Imperial Navy
),
Custodian Guard
,
Sisters of Silence
, and
Martian Mechanicum
forces that included the
Collegia Titanica
and
Legio Cybernetica
saw thousands of human worlds brought together under the Imperium. The Great Crusade ended with the corruption and treachery of the Primarch
Horus
, the instigator of the
Horus Heresy
.
The rebellion was fought across the galaxy. Horus, seeking to achieve a swift and decisive victory, led most of the traitor forces in a direct strike at the capital of humanity, in the
Battle of Terra
. In the final decisive battle between the Emperor and the Arch-Traitor, Horus was slain, leading to the breakup of the rebellion and the exile of the traitors to the
Eye of Terror
. However the Master of Mankind was himself mortally wounded. According to his instructions he was placed on the life-preserving
Golden Throne
, where, for nearly ten thousand years, he has remained. Though physically a carcass incapable of movement or communication, his omnipotent will extends across the million worlds of the Imperium, beaming the psychic energy of the
Astronomican
, soul-binding psychic humans and struggling against the
daemons
of the Warp. He endures by his undying will, and by the sustenance that only the souls of sacrificial
psykers
can provide. By the numberless masses of humanity he is worshiped as a god.
The immediate period following the Heresy,
The Scouring
and
Age of Rebirth
, saw the Imperium slowly rebuild its might and control over the domain of man. It also saw the last of the Emperor's loyal Primarchs either fall in battle, become gravely wounded, or disappear altogether. Nonetheless in the subsequent age known as
The Forging
, the Imperium enjoyed a period of growth and expansion. The Imperium's period of relative peace ended abruptly in mid-
M32
when an
Ork
Warboss
known only as
The Beast
launched the
greatest Waaagh! ever encountered
. The Beast was only halted at great cost by the
Adeptus Astartes
.
The Imperium saw further periods of severe instability throughout
M35
and
M36
, experiencing civil wars during the
Nova Terra Interregnum
and
Age of Apostasy
. This period saw the worst internal violence since the Heresy. Following the Age of Apostasy, the Imperium was again heavily reorganized and many
heretics
purged in the
Age of Redemption
. This new fervor culminated in a series of major
Crusades
and
Wars of Faith
most notably the
Redemption Crusades
and
Macharian Crusade
. However, while successful, this period exhausted the Imperium's military forces and in
The Waning
, many worlds were lost to
xenos
and
Chaos
attacks as well as internal rebellion.
The effects of The Waning ultimately culminated in late
M41
, known as the
Time of Ending
. Here the exhausted Imperium not only faced rejuvenated old threats, but also terrifying new enemies like the
Tyranids
and
Necrons
as well new smaller but dynamic alien empires such as the
Tau
,
Noisome Reek
, and
Ulumeathic League
. Beset on all sides by
heresy
and alien invasion, the future of the Imperium seems bleak.
The Black Crusade saw both the destruction of
Cadia
and the formation of the
Great Rift
, which has effectively split the Imperium in two. However some hope has been renewed thanks to the rebirth of the Primarch
Roboute Guilliman
, who has launched the
Indomitus Crusade
to reclaim worlds lost within the
Dark Imperium
.
During the
Arks of Omen Campaign
another Primarch,
Lion El'Jonson
, returned and became the Knight of the
Imperium Nihilus
.
Warzones
The Imperium is an entity beset by constant war. However a number of current engagements stand out as particularly fearsome. These include:
War Zone Cadia
- Though
Cadia
itself was smashed at the end of the
13th Black Crusade
, Imperial forces throughout the
Cadian Sector
continue to attempt to hold back the tides of
Chaos
.
War Zone
Nachmund
including the
War of Beasts
and
Nachmund Rift War
- The Imperium is battling to hold the strategically vital
Nachmund Gauntlet
from a variety of foes including
Orks
,
Chaos
,
Genestealer Cults
, and
Eldar
.
War Zone Baal
- Following their narrow victory in the
Devastation of Baal
, the
Blood Angels
are leading a major offensive throughout the
Red Scar
against the
Tyranids
.
War Zone Ultramar
- As a result of the
Plague Wars
the realm of
Ultramar
is now beset by not only the Forces of
Nurgle
but also the
Tyranids
.
War Zone Pariah Nexus
- Within the
Nephilim Sector
the Imperium has begun to move on the
Pariah Nexus
in an attempt to foil the machinations of the
Necrons
.
War Zone Armageddon
- Imperial forces continue to fight back both
Orks
and
Daemons
on the world of
Armageddon
. The 3rd Ork invasion of Armageddon under
Ghazghkull Mag Uruk Thraka
has splintered off into a massive
Waaagh!
known as
Da Great Waaagh!
.
War Zone Prospero
- Imperial forces resist the forces of
Tzeentch
under
Magnus the Red
around the
Prosperan Rift
.

and
Chalnath Expanse
.
War Zone Octarius
- As a result of Inquisitor
Kryptman
's actions to stop
Hive Fleet Leviathan
by having it clash with the
Ork Empire of Octarius
, the situation has become so dire that Inquisitor
Nashir Sahansun
has enacted the
Cordon Impenetra
to delay the advances of the xenos.

Political Structure
Main article:
High Lords of Terra
The Imperium is still nominally ruled by the Emperor of Mankind. However, since his ascension to the
Golden Throne
, the duty of actually ruling the Imperium falls to the
Senatorum Imperialis
— the Imperial Senate, led by the twelve
High Lords of Terra
. The identities and responsibilities of these High Lords may vary, as individuals inevitably die and their influence grows and wanes, but its members are always the leaders and representatives of the most powerful Imperial organisations.
When the revived Primarch
Roboute Guilliman
became
Lord Commander of the Imperium
, he rejoined the council of the High Lords.
Imperial Organisations
Organisation of the Imperial government.
The Imperial government is divided into four main bodies: the
Adeptus Terra
(The Priesthood of Terra), the
Adeptus Mechanicus
(the Priesthood of Mars), the
Adeptus Ministorum
(State Church), and
Inquisition
(Secret Police). These in turn answer to the
Senatorum Imperialis
, who rule in the name of the
Emperor
. In practice, most of the organisations comprising the Imperium are divisions of the vast
Adeptus Terra
. There are countless divisions, and some are so secretive their existence is known only to a few. The most well-known of the "secret" organisations is the
Officio Assassinorum
. Other organisations are secret enough that nothing besides their mere existence is known, such as the
Officio Sabatorum
and the
Templars Psykologis
.
The most important and well-known Imperial organisations include:
The
Adeptus Terra
, which includes:
The
Adeptus Administratum
— Responsible for administrative functions, it is the largest division, numbering countless scribes and petty officials. It administers the Imperium at every level, assessing

Military
As the largest single known polity in the Galaxy
, the Imperium maintains a wide array of military forces. At any given times there are countless billions fighting for the Imperium of Man. Similar to its political organization each branch of the Imperium’s military is independent, with their own duties, rituals, chain of command, tactical acumen and gear of war. Though diverse, the forces of the Imperium often work in conjunction with each other, and the larger the battle, the more likely it will be to see multiple Imperial factions engaged in the same war. Massive conflagrations, such as the
Chaos
invasions known as the
Black Crusades
or a major war zone such as the one surrounding the planet
Armageddon
, will attract representatives from all of Mankind’s military institutions.
The military forces of the Imperium consist of:
Planetary Defense Forces

Map of the Imperium
Segmentae
of the Imperium
Current map of the
Imperium
The Imperium is most commonly stated to consist of a million worlds spread out over the vast
galaxy
.
The disparate and widespread nature of Imperial territory means that a strongly centralised government would be unfeasible. The Imperium divides the galaxy into five administrative zones called
Segmentae Majoris
:
Segmentum Solar
— inner core and heart of the Imperium.
Segmentum Pacificus
Segmentum Obscurus
— a heavily-fortified region due to the dangers posed by its most infamous element, the Eye of Terror.
Segmentum Tempestus
Ultima Segmentum
— the largest province of all; its furthest extents are beyond the range of the Astronomican.
The Segmentae are the Imperium's primary administrative division. Each is divided into
sectors
, which are areas of space. The sectors in turn consist of
subsectors
, each containing a number of star
systems
which in turn are made up of individual worlds. These divisions and subdivisions are levels forming an administrative hierarchy. Each Segmentum Commander oversees his
Sector Commanders
, who in turn oversees Subsector Commanders, who oversee the individual
Planetary Governors
. The higher ranks in this system are usually combined with a basic planetary governorship as well as interplanetary duties. This system is the means by which the Imperium maintains control of the separate planets that comprise it.
The borders of the Imperium are marked by several uncharted regions of space which lay beyond the range of the
Astronomican
, areas which are frequently viewed with uncertainty and fear by Imperial citizens.
These include the
Halo Zone
on the Imperium's western-most border, the
Halo Stars
to its northwest, the
Ghoul Stars
to its northeast, the
Veiled Region
and
Mandragoran Stars
to its south, and the
Eastern Fringes
to its eastern-most border.
Following the
Thirteenth Black Crusade
and the resurrection of
Roboute Guilliman
, much of the Imperium's northwestern frontier became cut off from Terra. Becoming known as
Imperium Nihilus
, Guilliman has launched a new
Crusade
to reclaim these worlds.
The region south of the rift has become known as
Imperium Sanctus
.
Planetary Classification
Main article:
Class (planet)
Main article:
Aestimare
Due to its vast magnitude, the Imperium can afford for entire worlds to become specialised places where a majority, perhaps even the entirety, of the population is devoted to a single task. This could be heavy industry, military training, manufacturing, mining or agriculture. Planet-wide dedication serves to simplify logistics and increase outputs.
While not all Imperial worlds can be classified, the most commonly encountered types are:

Planetary Administration
Because of the distances involved and the unstable nature of Warp communication,
Planetary Governors
generally operate very autonomously. This allows quite a lot of variation in the regional governments. Most governorships are hereditary, but it is also possible for a planet to have an elected Planetary Governor, a tyrant Governor who rules by force of arms, or anything in between. So long as the Governor fulfills his duties to the Imperium, his rule will generally be accepted by the higher authorities. A rare few Planetary Governors preside over
feral
or
medieval worlds
where the Imperium has not, for whatever reason, seen fit to introduce modern technology. These Governors are often isolated from their subjects, sometimes even living on orbital installations, only interfering to control mutation and psykers, as well as to collect the modest tithes these planets pay.
The Imperial duties of a Planetary Governor include paying the planetary tithe to the Administratum, controlling psykers, mutation and heresy among the population, defending the planet and putting down rebellions against the local government (and thus against the Imperium). A serious responsibility is the maintenance of an adequate planetary defense force capable of defending the planet in the event of invasion. The
Planetary Defence Forces
(abbreviated to PDF) are expected to defeat attacks from minor foes, and in the case of major invasions to hold out until reinforcements arrive, which could take a period of months or even years.
A relatively small number of Imperial worlds are not ruled by a Governor, but are overseen by an alternate organisation such as the Adeptus Terra, Ecclesiarchy, Imperial Guard or Space Marines. These include the
Forge Worlds
of the
Adeptus Mechanicus
, whose inhabitants toil without pause to manufacture the weapons of the Emperor's armies (including
Mars
,
Gryphonne IV
and
Fortis Binary
), the
Cardinal Worlds
of the Ecclesiarchy, which are given entirely over to education and worship of the Emperor (
Ignatius Cardinal
,
Ophelia VII
), and the Space Marine
Chapter planets
(such as
Fenris
,
Macragge
,
Baal
, and
Medusa
).
Rebellion
The Imperial creed maintains that all of humanity must be brought into and kept within the Imperium. Several Imperial organisations are permanently occupied with suppressing any possibility of rebellion before they have a chance of developing. The common worship of the Emperor holds mankind together and instills loyalty towards the Imperium. Rebellions and uprisings on Imperial planets nonetheless remain constant. The nature and causes of a rebellion can fall into several categories: the government of an Imperial world may decide to secede from the Imperium, or may attempt to overthrow the local Imperial government. In the most insidious of cases the rebellion may be brought about by xenos or Chaos influence. In the more prosaic cases however, a government established through rebellion is not necessarily opposed by the Imperium, so long as it accedes fully to Imperial authority.
Besides outright war, there are many ways a rebellious world may be brought back into the Imperium. With its more secretive organisations, the Imperium is fully capable of carrying out subvert methods of restoring Imperial rule, including assassination, popular agitation, economic sabotage and terrorism. Sometimes a rebellion can be subdued by the removal of a single individual. Pro-Imperial groups or other anti-government forces can be infiltrated or supported.
Culture
Main article:
Imperial Culture
Main article:
Food and Drink of the Imperium
Main article:
Narcotics
While types of regimes and cultures differ greatly from world to world, there are commonly shared values and policies maintained by the Imperial central government. The worship of the
Emperor
as a god and the need for subject planets to pay the
Imperial Tithe
are rigidly enforced by agencies such as the
Ecclesiarchy
,
Adeptus Arbites
, and the feared
Inquisition
.
In addition, the Imperium is militantly xenophobic and will annihilate entire
non-human
species. Besides aliens,
Mutants
and
psykers
also face ruthless persecution
, though certain types of
Abhumans
such as
Ogryns
and
Ratlings
are tolerated. The Imperium views their violently xenophobic, anti-mutant, and anti-psyker policies as necessary for the survival of the human race amid a galaxy of violent aliens and
dark gods
.
In addition to aliens, mutants, and psykers, most forms of robotics and artificial intelligence are outlawed in the Imperium. This taboo was inherited from human civilizations of the
Dark Age of Technology
, who were nearly annihilated at the hands of the legendary
Iron Men
.
Thus while certain forms of robotics such as
Servitors
and
Machine Spirits
are sanctioned, any kind of true artificial sentience is declared to be a heretical
Abominable Intelligence
.
Everyday life differs greatly in the Imperium depending on which world one finds themselves on. However there is a common uniting factor: all activities are based around service to the Emperor and his regime. Life is often monotonous, with those on
Hive Worlds
spending their days as factory laborers before a short sleep cycle inside a cramped living quarters. Materialism outside of the nobility is virtually unknown. Whatever entertainment exists is heavily monitored by the
Ecclesiarchy
and is usually religious or political in nature. Most recreation is achieved through religious festivals, music, and drinking. Many, particularly those who can not find fulfillment outside of worship to the Emperor, resort to
drug
use to escape the reality of their lives. There are parks and shows for the nobility, but these are too expensive for a commoner to enjoy. On particular regressive worlds, gladiatorial combat may be used for entertainment. Against this backdrop most families will attempt to live a quiet humble life, hoping to never encounter the gaze of Imperial authorities or the horrors of the Galaxy.
Making the sign of the
Aquila
is a common display of loyalty and respect within the Imperium. This is achieved through moving ones hands together into the shape of a double-headed eagle.
Imperial Languages
Low Gothic
is the common tongue of the Imperium, spoken on most Imperial planets as a first or second language. Imperial worlds have inevitably developed their own dialects of Low Gothic over time.
High Gothic
(represented as Latinised English) dates from an age before the Imperium, and is used solely as a hieratic tongue by the divisions of the Adeptus Terra, the Inquisition and the Ecclesiarchy. Another prominent language of the Imperium is the
Lingua Technis
, the tongue of the
Adeptus Mechanicus
.
Religion
Main article:
Imperial Cult
Main article:
Ecclesiarchy
The Imperium's state religion, the
Imperial Cult
, is the one and only faith under Imperial law. While forms of worship may differ, they share a common belief that the
Emperor
is a God and the master of Mankind. This state religion is overseen by the
Ecclesiarchy
, the Imperial church and one of the most powerful and influential organizations among humanity. Any kind of deviation or apostasy against the Imperial Cult is classified as
heresy
and punishable by death.
The exception falls to the
Cult Mechanicus
, the state religion of the
Adeptus Mechanicus
. Since the
Treaty of Olympus
millennia ago their faith has been granted tolerance. While the Cult Mechanicus differs greatly from the tenets of the Ecclesiarchy in its reverence of the machine, it nonetheless worships the Emperor as the divine avatar of the
Machine God
known as the
Omnissiah
.
However other illegal faiths are practiced covertly by denizens of the Imperium, most notably among persecuted classes such as
mutants
. Unfortunately, it is common that often times this involves worship of the
Dark Gods
.

Wealth in the Imperium is distributed highly unequally, and those below are expected to serve those above. The Imperium primarily collects its wealth through its
Tithes
maintained on each world. Many
types of currency
exist in the Imperium, such as
Credits
,
Crowns
,
Aquilas
,
and
Thrones
.
Often goods, resources, and manpower are substituted as currency on a planetary level.
Examples of standard income in the Imperium is as follows, with the Thrones currency used. This however applies only to Inquisitorial
Acolytes
of each profession.

Travel
Main article:
Warp jump
Interstellar Travel in the Imperium is a perilous affair. Most travel is conducted by the
Imperial Fleet
, specifically the
Merchant Fleet
which oversees 90% of interstellar traffic.
In order to travel at
Faster-than-light
and thus reach their destination within a reasonable amount of time, Imperial vessels must activate their vessels
Warp Drive
and enter the
Immaterium
. While inside the Warp, genetically modified Humans known as
Navigators
use the
Terran
-based
Astronomican
as a beacon to guide their vessel to its destination. Many threats exist during Warp Travel, from the terrifying prospect of
Gellar Field
failure to temporal inconsistencies to massive
Warp Storms
.
Communication
Main article:
Astropath
While short-range more conventional methods exist, within the Imperium the only reliable means of rapid interstellar communication is by utilizing a type of
Psychic
Human known as an
Astropath
. Astropaths send telepathic messages into the Warp which are then intercepted by other Astropaths and passed along until they reach their intended destination. Astropathic Communication is fraught with inconsistencies and are not always reliable, with messages becoming garbled or being delivered well after or even before the time in which they were originally sent.
Imperial Dating System
Main article:
Imperial Dating System
The Imperial dating system is based upon "Anno Domini", although expressed in rather different terms. A full dating code consists of a "check" number, "year fraction" number, "year" number, and the millennium. The millennium is a suffix, represented by an "M" and the millennium number. The three digits preceding the millennium is the year within the millennium, running from 001-000 (one thousand). For example 0150930/M32 is the year 930 of the thirty second millennium (31,930 A.D.).
Since the formation of the
Great Rift
, the Imperium has introduced a radical new dating system to compensate for the extreme inconsistencies of time that has taken place across the galaxy. This is based around the planet's time in relation to the formation of the Rift itself.
Trivia
The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an
in-universe
point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found
here
.
The Adeptus Administratum estimates that there are about a million worlds in the Imperium, but even they don't know the exact number.
