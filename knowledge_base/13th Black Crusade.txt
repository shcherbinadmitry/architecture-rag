Thirteen times shall the Traitor King go forth. In the End Times the iron fortress shall be cast down. Its walls breached and its Gate forced open. Those that dwell beyond shall spill through it. The air shall burn and the ground shall melt, The Daemon shall lie down with the machine, Brother shall slay brother with fire and sword. And the sky-wound shall pour its malice forth. The Eye shall stare unblinking at its prize, and the Traitor King shall cross the bridge of stars. He shall return to finish the Warmonger's red work, Upon holy soil shall the fate of man be decided.

Massive casualties
The
13th Black Crusade
of
Abaddon the Despoiler
began in 999.
M41
,
and resulted in the largest mobilisation of both
Imperial
and
Chaotic
forces seen since the
Horus Heresy
.
Abaddon's strategy was based around the concept of
The Crimson Path
: by summoning enough
Daemons
to the surface of
Cadia
, he intended to overload the
Pylons
holding back the tides of the
Warp
on the planet. If he had succeeded, the Eye of Terror would have enveloped Cadia and transformed it into a hellish
Daemon World
, after which Abaddon would jump from planet to planet from the
Segmentum Obscurus
, expanding the Warp rift until
Terra
itself was swallowed up into the Eye.

Overview
Prelude
As the end of
M41
drew to a close, the first signs that
Abaddon the Despoilers
long-feared Thirteenth Black Crusade was imminent came in the form of numerous sightings of
Space Hulks
emerging from the
Warp
around the
Cadian Sector
. Though some were boarded by the
Adeptus Astartes
and others destroyed by orbital defenses, those that got by the Imperial blockade struck strategically important worlds and naval bases throughout the sector, crippling the region's naval forces. It was then that the dreaded
Chaos
vessel of
Nurgle
,
Plagueclaw
appeared in the outer reaches of the
Urthwart system
, further spreading pestilence wherever it went. Famed Imperial
Admiral
Quarren
would launch a hunt for the vessel but soon encountered something far more terrible. Ambushed around the
Frenerax Dust Cloud
, Quarren discovered, to his horror, that the Chaos Fleet was led by the dreaded
Terminus Est
, flagship of
Typhus
of the
Death Guard
,
Herald of Nurgle
. Quarren's fleet barely managed to survive the trap and escape. The Battle of Frenerax had been a costly disaster, but there was worse to come.
Now operating with impunity, Typhus's
Plague Fleet
spread pestilence throughout the Sector and the
Officio Medicae
were helpless to stop it. As the epidemic spread, apocalyptic sects began appearing on worlds afflicted, preaching that the
Emperor
's wrath had descended upon them and was a punishment for their sins. In what became known as the
Plague of Unbelief
, Chaos spread throughout the sector as the fanatical sects rioted against Imperial authorities. To compound the Imperium's problems,
Plague Zombies
soon emerged from the bodies of those struck down by disease. The
Hive World
of
Belis Corona
in the
Agripinaa Sector
was particularly affected by both the Plague of Unbelief and an infestation of Plague Zombies, and by the time Typhus's Plague Fleet arrived in the system the world was completely unable to resist him.
As Chaos swept through many Imperial worlds surrounding the Agripinaa, Cadian, and Belis Corona Sectors, cults preaching that the Imperium had forsaken the teachings of the Emperor grew in number. Imperial authorities, crippled by plague, could do little to stop the ensuing chaos and mob rule that these cults unleashed. Mysterious yet brutal raiders began to strike without warning throughout these sectors, annihilating small settlements and
Agri Worlds
. Meanwhile,
Astropaths
and the
Emperor's Tarot
consistently produced dire predictions. On
Cadia
itself, the worlds mysterious
pylons
erupted into life and vibrated intense
psychic
energy. The pylons appeared to be fighting to hold back the powers of the
Warp
that were pouring from the
Eye of Terror
at an unprecedented level but they were slowly destroying themselves in the process.
Between the anarchy, plague, and vicious raids spreading throughout the Agripinaa sector, the
Imperial Navy
's
Battlefleet Agripinaa
was forced to retreat back to its bases. Yet an even greater disaster was in the making on the Imperial world of
Lelithar
where a powerful figure arouse amongst the raving cults and fanatics, proclaiming himself the
Voice of the Emperor
. The Voice of the Emperor's cult spread throughout nearby worlds and he encouraged rebellion against Imperial rule. Soon, vicious battles between the Voice of the Emperor's cult and the faithful followers of the
Ecclesiarchy
erupted on the streets of worlds such as
Bar-El
,
Yayor
,
Amistel
, and
Albitern
. Attempts by the
Officio Assassinorum
to dispose of the Voice of the Emperor proved unsuccessful.
Betrayal on Cadia
Main article:
Battle of Tyrok Fields
Despite the deteriorating security situation and internal strife in the Imperial territories surrounding the
Eye of Terror
,
Cadia
remained a beacon of stability. But in order to counter the increasing frequency and scale of Chaos activity around the Cadian sector, the Cadian High Command issued an order that every
regiment
of the
Cadian Shock Troops
were to muster on Cadia itself. As a result, hundreds of extra landing fields were assembled at
Kasr Tyrok
fields in preparation for the reinforcements. Millions of men had already been assembled when the
Volscani Cataphracts
regiment, considered by many to be the most hardened fighters in the sector, landed on Cadia. In honor of the reputation of the Volscani regiment, the Cadian High Command itself gathered at Tyrok Fields to personally greet the arriving forces. However this would prove to be a disastrous decision for Cadia, as the Volscani soon revealed their true colours.
The Battle of Tyrok Fields
Exchanging their Cadian and Imperial banners for those of Chaos, the Volscani forces opened fire on the Cadian assembly on Tyrok Fields and annihilated most of the Cadian High Command in one fell swoop. Only a skillful counterattack by
Lord Castellan
Ursarkar E. Creed
, who managed to take control of the reeling Cadian forces, prevented further calamity. Now installed as
Governor
of Cadia due to the murder of the previous holder of the position, Creed ordered the Cadian forces to dig in as he dispatched requests for aid throughout the whole of the Imperium. The
Administratum
and
Space Marines
heeded the call, mobilizing the sector with unprecedented scale and pace. After an engagement with a raiding party of
Night Lords
led by the vicious
Tarraq Darkblood
, a unit of highly trained
Kasrkin
were dispatched into the Eye of Terror directly on a reconnaissance mission, desperate to find some kind of indication of where the first blow of the inevitable Chaos invasion would land. The reconnaissance mission proved a disaster when the force became stranded on the
Daemon World
of
Urthwart
and was subsequently destroyed by the dreaded ship
Planet Killer
. As Urthwart collapsed into itself, a Chaos fleet of hundreds of warships,
Space Hulks
, and transports emerged from the depths of the Eye of Terror. Accompanying them were not only the
Plagueclaw
and
Terminus Est
but also two captured
Blackstone Fortresses
. Imperial Admiral
Pulaski
mustered whatever ships he could in the
Ormantep system
, ready to fight and die to give the defenders of Cadia whatever time they could to prepare themselves. Though the Imperial fleet fought bravely, it was annihilated by the massive Chaos armada. Quarren, however, managed to escape with what remained of his fleet, but in doing so had left the way clear for a splinter Chaos Fleet to ravage the Agripinaa Sector.
Now virtually defenseless, the worlds of the Agripinaa Sector were ravaged by the Plague Fleet of Typhus and his legions of
Death Guard
and
Daemons
of
Nurgle
. Only an intervention by the
Howling Griffons
Space Marine Chapter
,
Jouran Dragoons
Imperial Guard
, and
Legio Astorum
Titan Legion
prevented the total collapse of Imperial rule in the sector. The Imperial forces, further reinforced by the
Death Spectres
Chapter, even managed to lay siege the world of Lelithar, the original world of the Voice of the Emperor which had since been captured by Typhus's forces and legions of crazed cultists. However, the bloody siege has cost the lives of millions and is grinding mercilessly towards an uncertain conclusion.
Meanwhile the
Emperor's Children
, led by
Lucius the Eternal
, butchered the world of
Belisar
while warbands of
Night Lords
moved onto
Scarus Sector
, spreading terror and fear to the Imperial Populace. Cells of
Alpha Legion
revealed themselves across
Segmentum Obscurus
, badly delaying Space Marine reinforcements in protracted struggles. In the wake of the Traitor Marines came terrifying hordes of Chaos:
Mutants
,
Chaos Cultists
, and
Daemons
as well as the
Traitor Titan Legions
of the
Dark Mechanicum
.
Soon, every world within a thousand light years of the Eye of Terror became embroiled in conflict.
While hordes of Chaos forces ravaged the surrounding sectors, the main Chaos Fleet of Abaddon the Despoiler and the
World Eaters
Chaos Lord
Kossolax the Foresworn
pushed towards Cadia itself. The Chaos fleet quickly overwhelmed the defenses on the world of
Solar Mariatus
, the outermost planet of the
Cadian System
. Here, traitor forces established a forward base of operations to launch attacks throughout the entire system. Capturing the prison world of
St. Josmane's Hope
, the
Violators
Chaos Space Marine
warband managed to capture its millions of inmates and use them as slaves or conscript them into its armies. Admiral Quarren had done what he could, but the overwhelming Chaos Fleet could not be stopped and after three days of hard fighting, the majority of the Imperial Fleet in the Cadian System had either been crippled or destroyed. After overrunning Cadia's orbital bases, the planet finally stood defenseless and Abaddon's long awaited invasion of Cadia had finally begun.
The Battle of Medusa
Meanwhile, Abaddon launched a massive assault on
Medusa
, homeworld of the
Iron Hands
Space Marine Chapter. As the Iron Hands recruited strictly from Medusa, the Marines were forced to defend it above all else. All ten of the immense
Land Behemoth
mobile
Fortress-monasteries
of the Chapter were mobilized along with the heavily armored
Planetary Defense Forces
of Medusa for the defense. Assaulted by armoured regiments of the
Haradni 13th
Traitor Guard
, the ensuing armoured clash was one of the largest in the Imperium since the
Battle of Tallarn
during the
Horus Heresy
, with the Chaos forces fielding over ten thousand tanks. The ensuing battle raged for five days, with the Traitor forces gradually pushing towards the mobile fortresses of the Iron Hands. The Fortresses, each possessing the firepower of the mighty
Ordinatus
war machines of the
Adeptus Mechanicus
, decimated hundreds of tanks with each salvo.
Using this support to finally break the Traitor lines, the Iron Hands were nonetheless outflanked by enemy armour, which began to pour fire into the vulnerable rear of their mobile fortresses. This forced the Iron Hands to launch a furious counter-attack led by
Assault Squads
, taking heavy casualties in the process but succeeding in stopping the traitor flanking maneuver and sending them into a disorderly retreat. The Iron Hands then used their
Predator Annihilator
tanks to decimate the retreating Traitor forces, securing Medusa at last.
The Battle for the Cadian Gate
Space Marines
and
Chaos
forces battle in the 13th Black Crusade
Meanwhile, Abaddon began his long-awaited invasion of Cadia with a fierce orbital bombardment, one so powerful it shook even the vaunted
Cadian Shock Troopers
. Along with the bombardment came legions of
Chaos Space Marines
, the
Lost and the Damned
,
Daemons
, and
Titans
, who flooded the fortress world of Cadia in unprecedented numbers.
The Cadian forces fought bravely and stubbornly, however, and were aided by the legendary
Thirteenth Company
of the
Space Wolves
.
Many
Crone Worlds
around the Eye of Terror would come under attack from Chaos forces and immortal
Phoenix Lords
would lead Eldar defenses in the
Belial IV
System, attempting to destroy a dark cathedral erected by the
Word Bearers
.
The Eldar would also engage
Ahriman
of the
Thousand Sons
after the
sorcerer
managed to breach the
Webway
in a hunt for the mysterious
Black Library
.
Elsewhere, Lord
Thybault Helican XXIII
lead the defense of the
Thracian Primaris
system of
Scarus Sector
against a rising tide of deviant cultists. Many
Astropaths
died and the
Lord Jiudiciary
of the
Adeptus Arbites
of Thracian Primaris reported a 400% increased activity of deviant cults.
While the forces of Cadia managed to hold off the Chaos armies in a bloody stalemate, the
Imperial Navy
would receive reinforcements from
Cypra Mundi
and launch a counterattack to drive Abaddon's forces back into the
Cadian Gate
. Using these resources to his advantage, Admiral Quarren managed to defeat Chaos fleets many times the size of his own, allowing a flood of Imperial reinforcements to break the Chaos blockades of Cadia and the
Scelus Sector
. In the Belis Corona System, the entirety of
Battlefleet Gothic
would storm into the fray. The Imperial Navy was staking everything on this final, sector-wide retaliation; if it were to fail, the whole of Battlefleet Obscurus would be so weakened it would have no hope of repelling Abaddon's invasion.
While the Imperial Navy reinforcements bolstered the defenses of
Battlefleet Cadia
, Abaddon would unveil the next step in his plan. The
Word Bearers
Legion, led by the
Dark Apostle
Erebus
, would enact terrible rituals on the world they had captured, unleashing
Warp Storms
and hordes of Daemons across outlying sectors around the Eye of Terror such as
Scelus
and
Caliban
. Cut off from aid, these sectors were ravaged by the powers of Chaos. Imperial forces would not falter however, and a counterattack led by Creed and the
White Scars
Chapter was launched on and from Cadia, engaging Chaos forces throughout the sector in a surprise move of resolve.
After holding out for many long weeks of stubborn resistance, the defenders of the Cadian Gate received further aid when reinforcements from dozens of Space Marine Chapters finally began to arrive. Among them were the
Blood Angels
, who assaulted the largest horde of
World Eaters
encountered in living memory on the world of
Kasr Partox
and defeated the forces of
Kossolax
and a
Bloodthirster
on
Agripinaa
.
Meanwhile, the
Dark Angels
under
Supreme Grand Master
Azrael
and the
Space Wolves
under
Great Wolf
Logan Grimnar
engaged the forces of Typhus on
Macharia
,
Korolis
, and
Kasr Sonnen
, managing to put aside their past differences and bitter rivalry.
Further reinforcements across the theatre of war included the
Black Templars
and
Imperial Fists
.
Lord Inquisitor
Torquemada Coteaz
would also appear in the waves of reinforcements, leading
strike forces
of
Grey Knights
against Daemons in the Agripinnaa Sector as well as on
Kasr Holn
and
Xersia
. The
White Scars
under
Khajog Khan
also arrived, forcing Abaddon to lift the sieges of three Cadian
Kasrs
before being entrapped and destroyed in a bloody fight to the end.
With so many of the legendary Space Marines arriving, the Imperium was at long last able to see a real chance of turning back Abaddon's Thirteenth Black Crusade.
However, the rituals of Erebus of the Word Bearers reached their peak shortly after the arrival of Space Marine reinforcements. Through the sacrifice of a million innocents, the entire region around the Eye of Terror was attacked by a
Warp storm
so intense that inter-system travel was rendered impossible and cutting the warzone off from further Imperial reinforcements. Taking advantage of this, Typhus would unleash the full strength of the Death Guard upon the Agripinaa Sector, which now was reduced to ruins.
The most chilling development for the Imperium however was the slow encroachment of the
Planet Killer
upon Cadia itself as the war entered its final stages.
The Imperium's problems were further compounded by xenos forces, even at this late stage in the war. A
Tyranid
splinter of
Hive Fleet Leviathan
began to encroach on Segmentum Obscurus and assault Belis Corona while warbands of
Orks
ravaged the
Scarus Sector
in what became known as the
Green Krusade
.
Rumors persisted among Imperial sources that the
Daemon
Primarchs
have returned at the helm of the Crusade to herald in the
End Times
.
Fall of Cadia
Though the Volscani attack and the wave of chaos that swept through Cadia after it caused much damage, after several months of fighting the Imperium had reestablished its hold on the Fortress World and many considered the worst of the crisis to have passed. Most of the major Kasr fortress-cities of Cadia had been retaken and Chaos fleets had been scattered across the Cadian Gate. Such was the confidence of many Imperials that victory celebrations were already being actively planned. However in truth, the attacks so far were merely the first wave in Abaddon’s grand campaign.
Opposing him were the shattered remaining Imperial defenders consisting of Creed and the Cadian Shock Troops including the
Cadian 8th
,
Space Wolves
under
Orven Highfell
and
Sven Bloodhowl
, the
Dark Angels
4th Company under
Korahael
,
Black Templars
of the
Cruxis Crusade
under
Marshal
Marius Amalrich
, the
Order of Our Martyred Lady
under
Eleanor
and
Genevieve
,
House Raven
under
Vardus
, and various other hodgepodge surviving formations.
The first indication that something was amiss was when a Imperial picket fleet under
Admiral
Quarren
detected a massive Chaos armada exiting
Warp
space near the Cadian system. The Chaos fleet was of unparalleled size and included such infamous vessels as the
Terminus Est
. Worst of all however was a massive
Blackstone Fortress
, the
Will of Eternity
, aboard which Abaddon now made his command center. While Quarren led a valiant defense from the
Emperor Class Battleship
Might of the Faithful
, the Imperials were annihilated after only 77 minutes.
Creed, still the commanding officer on Cadia, responded to the disappearance of Quarren’s fleet by immediately holding a new council of war alongside the likes of
Wolf Lord
Sven Bloodhowl
,
Master
Korahael
,
Inquisitor
Talia Daverna
,
Canoness
Eleanor
of the
Order of Our Martyred Lady
, and
Magos
Klarn
. However, despite Creed’s best efforts to create a unified command to counter the coming attack, the various Imperial factions present still proved too stubborn and rebellious. Creed lamented that he did not have one true army from which to defend Cadia, but many smaller independent forces with their own agendas.
Saint Celestine
appears on the battlefield
Meanwhile,
Trazyn the Infinite
's collection on
Solemnace
was devastated in upheavals. This provoked him into action, and using the
Celestial Orrery
he traced he disturbances to the
Eye of Terror
. Trazyn was moved to resolve the crisis by going to Cadia. At the same time, Mechanicum Magos
Belisarius Cawl
was instructed by the
Harlequin
Shadowseer
Sylandri Veilwalker
to investigate a long-abandoned planet devastated in the
4th Black Crusade
. On the world he discovered the presence of Pylons much like Cadia and is then instructed by Veilwalker to head to Cadia. The Imperials also had reinforcements heading to Cadia in the form of the
Phalanx
, which had just
defeated
a Chaos invasion of its own.
As Creed planned what move to make next on Cadia, Bloodhowl and his
Firehowlers
Great Company
alongside many other Space Marine Chapters struck directly for the
Will of Eternity
itself and launched a bold boarding action. While the Marines were able to penetrate deep into the fortress and even attack Abaddon himself, they were no match for the Warmaster’s might and Bloodhowl was forced to lead a retreat. During the withdrawal, Bloodhowl’s boarding craft was shot down and plunged into the Blackstone Fortress.
After defeating the boarding attempt Bloodhowl, Abaddon immediately positioned the
Will of Eternity
over Cadia and prepared to use its massive Warp gun to destroy its many Kasr fortresses. He also acceded to the demands of his half-daemonic Khornate
Chosen
Urkrathos
to be allowed to lead the
Hounds of Abaddon
in a surface assault. Their main objective was to disable the
Pylons
emitting null-fields around Kasr Kraf, which would interfere with the Warp Gun of the
Will of Eternity
. Urkrathos and his warriors slaughtered their way across a citadel of the
Sisters of Battle
near Kasr Kraf while the bulk of his army besieged the Dark Angels inside their own cruiser. Meanwhile,
Krom Gat
led an attack to pin the Imperial armies at Kasr Kraf in place, coming into direct conflict with the
Iron Wolves
Great Company
.
After hours of heavy fighting, Urkrathos pushed through the determined
Ecclesiarchy
defense and claimed the Sororitas Shrine. The act proved the final push to allow for the warrior of Khorne to ascend to
Daemonhood
, and he merged with his Daemonic familiar
Artesia
. The newly elevated Daemon of Khorne then led the final attack against the Sisters of Battle, grievously wounding the twin Cannonesses
Genevieve
and
Eleanor
. While the Chaos forces were successful in claiming the shrine and allowing the
Will of Eternity
to begin its bombardment, the Iron Warriors under Krom Gat were pushed back at Kasr Kraf by the Iron Wolves. It was now obvious that Kasr Kraf was Abaddon's chief target, and as a result most Imperial forces across Cadia began to congregate there. Urkrathos was undeterred, and led a massive offensive against Kasr Kraf.
After many long grueling battles, the Black Legion-led assault finally reached the gates of
Kasr Kraf
. This was aided in no small part by Urkrathos, who raised his own dead and reinvigorated them as mindless blood-crazed warriors of Khorne. The Chaos forces took grievous losses in the faced of disciplined
Kasrkin
, but their sheer supernatural might allowed them to ultimately prevail. Meanwhile, Abaddon's intelligence chief
Cacadius Siron
consumed the brains of a recovered Cadian trooper, discovering that large amounts of Space Wolves remained aboard the
Will of Eternity
and were heading towards the vessels
Void Shield
generator region.
By now, the Kasrkin at Kasr Kraf were killing one
Berzerker
for every thirty of their own, losses that were unacceptable to any Space Marine force. Even more problematic for the Chaos forces, more powerful
Daemons
like
Bloodletters
could not manifest so close to the Null-array. Urkrathos was thus only aided by
Flesh Hounds
when a counterattack by the
Black Templars
under
Marshal
Amalrich
emerged from their defences. Covertly,
Trazyn the Infinite
had by this point landed on Cadia and was secretly aiding the Imperial defenders with his own
Deathmarks
. Trazyn and his warriors even disabled a Chaos
Baneblade
discreetly. Amid the chaotic fighting at the gates of Kasr Kraf, Eleanor and Genevieve reappeared to attack Urkrathos. In the ensuing battle, Urkrathos killed both of the Cannonesses. Meanwhile, aboard of the
Will of Eternity
, Abaddon's adoptive "daughter"
Morkath
led hunting parties to try and stop the Space Wolves.
By now, Urkrathos had finally reached the Null-Array of Kasr Kraf, slaughtering
Mechanicum
troops before him and destroying the infernal device which was poison to his Daemonic kin. Just then,
Saint Celestine
emerged to attack the Khornate warrior directly. While Urkrathos was defeated in the renewed attack led by Celestine, he welcomed his temporary banishment to the
Warp
as he knew
Abaddon
would soon open fire with the Warp Gun of the
Will of Eternity
and annihilate his killers.
Meanwhile aboard the Blackstone Fortress itself, Morkath and Siron reached the Space Wolves but were shocked to find that the
Legion of the Damned
had arrived to aid them. The Chaos counterattack would have been pushed back had Abaddon not arrived, using his might to defeat even the ghostly warriors. Abaddon mortally wounded Sven Bloodhowl, but it soon became apparent that he had fallen into the Wolf Lord's trap as the
Phalanx
appeared and unleashed a punishing salvo at the
Will of Eternity
. Abaddon and his lieutenants were forced to teleport away. The
Phalanx
disabled the Will of Eternity and cleared Cadia's skies of hostile aircraft. While Kasr Kraf was secure for the time being, the Inquisition judged the situation doomed and recommended
virus bombing
Cadia to spare it from the Archenemy.
Creed held a new council, this time with new faces from the
Phalanx
present including
Belisarius Cawl
,
Tor Garadon
, Baroness
Vardus
of
House Raven
,
Ruis Tracinto
and his
Crimson Fists
, and now even Trazyn. Such was the desperate situation for the Imperium that they even agreed to a temporary alliance with the Xeno construct. Cawl laid out his plan to amplify the Cadian Pylons, pushing back the Chaos horde and perhaps even weakening the Eye of Terror itself.
However as they made their preparations, Abaddon identified the position of the Imperial council and personally led an assault with his elite. As the Imperials desperately evacuated Creed via
Valkyrie
gunship, his faithful standard bearer
Jarran Kell
gave his life staying behind to hold back the enemy. The valiant Cadian fell personally battling Abaddon. The Chaos forces next drove towards where Cawl and Trazyn were working, forcing the two scientists to personally sweep aside the enemy as Creed arrived with fresh
Vostroyan
reinforcements to lead a counterattack.
It was then that Abaddon emerged before Cawl and Trazyn, rapidly turning the tide of the battle in the favor of Chaos. Trazyn then used his many Tesseract Labyrinths to summon a whole army before him, including the Heresy-era
Lieutenant Commander
Cerantes
of the
Ultramarines
. After being forced to kill Cerantes, Abaddon renewed his advance but found that Cawl and Trazyn had escaped. The Warmaster then was assailed by the combined might of what Creed had arrived with, including
Kasrkin
,
Space Wolves
accompanied by
Wulfen
, Black Templars led by the
Emperor's Champion
, and the
Adeptus Custodes
. Trazyn continued to summon new slaves from his collection, including the missing
Inquisitor
Katarinya Greyfax
. Saint Celestine arrived at the head of a new Sororitas host, diving into battle against the Despoiler. Under this combined assault even Abaddon began to weaken and he took immense damage. Cawl and Trazyn were able to reactivate the Pylons, causing Abaddon's daemonic allies to vanish before its effects and also weakening Celestine, allowing Abaddon to finally best the
Living Saint
. Abaddon then moved next on his original target, Creed, and an unequal duel broke out. As Abaddon struck down Creed, a wounded Celestine stabbed the Warmaster through the back. The wound forced Abaddon to teleport away, knowing that soon the reactivated pylons would strand him on Cadia.
Cadia dies
Back aboard the
Vengeful Spirit
, Abaddon received word from Morkath aboard the
Will of Eternity
that she still lived and was preparing to use the Fortress to conquer Cadia and eventually
Terra
itself. However Abaddon had other plans, and betrayed his own creation by using the
Vengeful Spirit
to push the
Will of Eternity
into Cadia's gravitational pull. The Fortress smashed into Cadia, causing massive destruction and forcing many Imperials to begin to evacuate.
The Imperial evacuation plans had been worked out at the time of the
2nd Black Crusade
, however, and were often completely outdated, confused, and just not feasible.
Furthermore, the Inquistion had secretly drafted the "Extremis Protocols", effectively forbidding an evacuation of Cadia due to the risks of corruption being spread by its overly Chaos-exposed defenders.
Creed had covertly worked against the "Extremis Protocols", however, and augmented as well as updated the old evacuation plans which he triggered after the
Will of Eternity
's crash. An attempt by high-ranking Inquisitor
Talia Daverna
to prevent the entire evacuation was overruled by Greyfax, and Daverna was later shot by Cadians when she continued her blocking efforts.
Many Cadian units subsequently tried to follow the orders as well as they could, fighting through enemy lines to reach evacuation points. In the orbit, Imperial Navy ships desperately struggled to pick up survivors, even as they were beset by Chaos vessels and the expanding Warp due to the collapsing pylons.
In contrast, the forces of Chaos simply abandoned most of their armies on Cadia, leaving millions of Traitor Guardsmen and cultists to die.
Meanwhile, with the pylons failing, Celestine was back at her maximum power and led a withdrawal of Imperial forces from doomed Cadia. As Creed and parts of his Cadian 8th held the line against the returned Daemonic legions, the Imperials fled Cadia as the planet was dragged into the Warp. The Phalanx led the surviving Imperial vessels out of the system.
Aboard the
Vengeful Spirit
, Abaddon was told by one of his seers that Cawl has a precious artifact aboard his vessel. What the artifact was was not known, but Abaddon considered it of immense importance and he began an attempt to capture Cawl's ship. The Black Legion's warships assailed the Imperial evacuation fleet just as it was about to jump into the Warp. Cawl's ship was captured just as the Phalanx and Imperial warships jumped into the Immaterium. Aboard Cawl's vessel, the Magos and Inquisitor Greyfax were guided by Celestine's vision to seek salvation on the outer planet of the system,
Kalisus
. Fleeing the Black Legion fleet, they arrived on the prophesied world and landed on it with Cawl's artifact. Accompanying this force were Black Templars and
Tempestus Scions
.
The surviving Imperial defenders retreat to
Klaisus
where they're rescued by the
Ynnari
Eldar
and ushered into the
Webway
.
However the Imperials were followed by the Black Legion, and Cawl fled with his artifact as the Black Templars led by the
Emperor's Champion
fought a rearguard action. Just as the Imperials seemed doomed, Celestine led the Black Legion into an
Eldar
trap led by
Eldrad Ulthran
. Drawn from
Ulthwé
,
Biel-Tan
, and other
Craftworlds
as well as
Wyches
, the Black Legion was ultimately forced to retreat. After the Eldar saved the Imperials, they guided them into a
Webway Portal
.

Main article:
Battle of the Agripinaa System
Although the majority of the 13th Black Crusade was fought near the Cadian Gate, the general chaos of the incursion allowed several splinter fleets to break off from the forces spilling from the Eye of Terror, and wreak havoc much farther afield.
One such splinter fleet, under the command of
Warmaster
Varan the Undefeatable
, made for the planet
Perlia
, Varan having learned of the existence of the
Shadowlight
, an immensely powerful
xenos
artifact that could awaken the powers of latent
psykers
and, worse, could have triggered the expansion of the
Eye of Terror
that Abaddon sought. Varan came to the planet on the Despoiler's orders, having pledged to retrieve the artifact.
The artifact was being kept in a
Mechanicus
shrine under the joint control of the Mechanicus and the
Ordo Xenos
, but the planet as a whole was woefully undefended. However, at the center of the Imperial forces were the faculty of the
Schola Progenium
, which included battle-hardened veterans from the
Imperial Navy
, the
Guard
, the
Celestians
of the
Adepta Sororitas
, and, last but not least, the celebrated Hero of the Imperium,
Commissar
Ciaphas Cain
. These veterans were able to muster the citizens of Perlia into a halfway competent
PDF
, and drilled their own students into a surprisingly effective fighting force, in conjunction with the Mechanicus and Inquisitorial soldiery at the shrine.
During the final defense of the shrine, Cain and his aide,
Ferik Jurgen
, defeated Varan in hand-to-hand combat, and his force was annihilated by the surprise appearance of a
Necron
scouting force. The Imperial forces were able to evacuate before the Necrons arrived.
Although the Shadowlight was lost to the Necrons,
Inquisitor
Amberley Vail
conceded that this was preferable to the disastrous consequences of allowing Abaddon to possess it.
Another splinter fleet, under the command of
Urkrathos
,
Chosen of Abaddon
, was dispatched to the
Dark Mechanicus
Forge World
of
Chaeronia
, to retrieve an ancient
Castigator
-class
Titan
, along with an army of lesser Titans, but these were destroyed first by a small strike group of the
Grey Knights
. Urkrathos razed most of the planet to the ground in fury, but was forced to withdraw empty-handed.
Another major invasion took place in the
Diamor System
, where the Black Legion
Sorcerer
Xorphas
led an invasion of the System in the intent to expand the
Crimson Path
.

Aftermath

Main article:
Ultramar Campaign

Terran Crusade
Main article:
Indomitus Crusade
Of the population of Cadia, only around three million survived the planet's destruction and Lord Castellan Creed was missing and presumed dead.
But far worse was the aftermath of Cadia's destruction. With the planet destroyed, the
Pylons
holding back the Eye of Terror faltered and the first step of Abaddon's Crimson Path apparently succeeded.
This is one of the key theories for why the
Great Rift
formed and subsequently divided the galaxy in two with a series of massive
Warp Rifts
.
After Cadia's destruction, the Black Legion continued to rampage across Imperial space, coming into conflict with
Ultramar
in the
Ultramar Campaign
.
Black Legion forces collected the remains of Cadia's shattered Pylons and stored them aboard their warships, using the Warp-negating effects to try and cut off Warp travel to Terra by dropping them at strategic locations along the Throneworld's Warp routes. Nearly all the Warp routes to Terra were closed, but the Black Legion's plan was foiled by the
Adeptus Custodes
and
Sisters of Silence
at the Battle of
Vorlese
.
As for the Despoiler himself, he was not seen again until the
War of Beasts
on
Vigilus
.
Around the same time as Cadia's destruction,
Roboute Guilliman
was reborn thanks to the temporary alliance between Imperial forces and the
Eldar
.
After the
Terran Crusade
, he returned to the
Imperial Throneworld
and resumed his duties as
Lord Commander of the Imperium
.
The Great Rift created in the wake of the 13th Black Crusade ravaged the Galaxy, with even
Terra itself
coming under assault from
Daemonic
forces.
The newly reappointed Lord Commander Guilliman organized the
Indomitus Crusade
to reclaim territory, particularly beyond the cut-off region of Imperial space now known as
Imperium Nihilus
.
Belisarius Cawl
and the new line of
Primaris Space Marines
were key in the Imperial counteroffensive.
The end of the 13th Black Crusade and the subsequent formation of the Great Rift were significant enough to herald a new age in Imperial history known as the
Age of the Dark Imperium
.

Background
The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an
in-universe
point of view. A detailed explanation of the term "Trivia" as used in the Lexicanum can be found
here
.
The Thirteenth Black Crusade was the background to the worldwide
Warhammer 40,000
Eye of Terror Campaign
, which resulted in a minor victory for the forces of Chaos and gave Abaddon a foothold in the
Cadian Gate
, though he suffered grievous losses to his fleet.
In 2017 Games Workshop released
Gathering Storm: Fall of Cadia
which changed much of the lore and status of Cadia and the 13th Black Crusade as a whole. It established that Cadia was destroyed and the status of many of the characters and forces from the earlier campaign are left unresolved.
