Overview
The Imperium's Titans are mechanical, humanoid-shaped war-machines; some Titan classes reaching up to a hundred feet in height. Their presence inspires nothing but terror - few enemies can stand against them - and only another Titan can equal their power. It is thought that the first Titans were developed on
Mars
during the
Age of Strife
in order to combat the
Cy-Carnivora
.
A human pilot, linked directly to the machine via a
Throne Mechanicum
, controls the movement of a Titan merely through thought. Titans are powered by
plasma generators
, as nothing else can provide the vast amount of energy required. Energy fields known as
void shields
are the Imperial Titan's first line of defense. The shields can absorb incoming damage until becoming overloaded. A Titan's limbs move using electrically-motivated fibre bundles which act as synthetic muscles.
Imperial Titans are transported world to world by Mechanicum-operated
Conquesitus Arks
and
Heavy Transports
and landed via
Drop-vaults
and
Drop-Cathedrals
.
Titan Classes & Variants
Titans are divided into a number of general types depending on their size and function. The Battle Titans are the most numerous and general type. Widely varying in size, they stand between 40 and 80 feet in height. Some types of Battle Titan have been built by the forces of
Chaos
over the years since the Heresy, or have been corrupted from their original design. These Titans are unique to the forces of the
Traitor Titan Legions
.
Each general type of Titan is further divided into
classes
. The most basic class of Battle Titan is the
Warlord
. Finally, each class has a number of
variants
, determined by the weapons it mounts.

Crew
Each Titan is manned by a crew consisting of a single
Princeps
in command, assisted by
Moderati
, a Tactical Officer, a Chief Engineer, an engineering crew, and
Servitors
. The number of each is dependent on the type of Titan.
A Princeps commands his Titan through the
MIU
link to the Titan's "spirit," controlling the Titan's movements through his thoughts. The Titan becomes an extension of him; when damaged he feels pain; when victorious he feels elation. This link grows so strong that his mental health will slowly deteriorate when unlinked. Because of the immense power of a Titan's spirit, the Princeps must also possess the strongest of wills to survive such a link. He can assume direct control of any system, though it is usually aiming and fire control that is taken. Regardless, Titans must have both Princeps and crew to function. The Princeps' relation to the Titan is similar to that of a
Space Marine
within a
Dreadnought
; however Titans eventually form their own minds from centuries of experience. The link in some cases gets so strong that the Princeps becomes physically-integrated into the Titan, and cannot be removed until they die.
the
ejector system
of a Titan's head
All Titans are fitted with
ejector systems
such that when the need arises, the crew may attempt to escape a destroyed or disabled Titan or prior to its imminent demise. This can happen based on the tactical assessment of the Princeps, or in an effort to escape impending catastrophic reactor explosion. The crew will move from their battlestations toward the cabin in the head, which then activates drives and
anti-grav
propulsors to eject from the body of the Titan. Priorly to this, the crew may attempt to switch-off the reactor of the Titan leaving it intact for salvage or recovery later. Alternatively they may attempt to rig the Titan's reactor to explode, denying it to the enemy, and thus triggering the ejector system. Should the ejector system be undamaged the head will fly away from the battlefield to safety, though a damaged ejector system may result in premature crashes, the crew landing in either friendly territory yet severely injured by the crash, landing in enemy territory and be captured or slain, or simply killed on impact with the ground. Should they survive and make a recovery, the crew may then seek to pilot another Titan should the Legio be able to provide them one.
An example of such use was when Princeps
Ferantha Krezoc
was forced to use the Ejector System of the
Gloria Vastator
, following a rupture in its power plant. She ordered her moderati to accelerate the reactors destruction such that it would detonate the Titan and devastate the enemies surrounding it, and then for the crew to make their way into the head before ejection and flight to relative safety.
In another instance, the
Chaos Warlord Titan
Omnia Sangui
of
Legio Vulpa
was forced to eject after taking severe damage from Princeps
Esha Ani Mohana
commanding the
Reaver Titan
Domine Ex Venari
as well as a group of other Reaver Titans.
Weapons
Imperial Titans mount enormous complex weapons, from rapid-firing cannons that hurl a torrent of shells to sophisticated
laser weapons
to
plasma weapons
that unleash barely controlled energies. Each are capable of mass destruction that would devastate armies.
Imperial Titans may mount:
Apocalypse Missile Launchers
Gatling Blasters
Hellstorm Cannons
Inferno Guns
Melta Cannons
Mine Dispenser Missiles
Plasma Annihilators
Plasma Blastguns
Plasma Destructors
Quake Cannons
Thermal Cannons
Titan close combat weapons
: often in the form of giant
Power fists
or
Chainswords
Titan Vortex Missiles
Warp Missiles
Turbo-laser Destructors
Volcano Cannons
Vulcan Mega-bolters
Equipment
Titans can be fitted with non-weapon systems, to enhance and augment their performance.
Imperial Titans may mount:
Cameleoline
- Reactive Cameleoline plating on the surface of a Titan can display a visual illusion of the background in real-time, hiding a titan from sight as well as obscuring other sensors and detection systems, protecting it from ranged fire from afar. This is no longer effective once an enemy has come into close combat with the Titan.
Jump Packs
- Colossal jump boosters are capable of allowing Titans to leap over buildings and other Titans. Those from incapacitated enemies may be salvaged, but such jump packs are destroyed when a Titan suffers catastrophic reactor or leg damage
COBRA
-
Command Override Battle Reaction Automation
is a generic term for advanced
Cogitators
that allow the Titan's
Machine spirit
to fire faster than even their mortal crew could be able to.
Missile Relay
- Missile Relays allow a Titan to guide launched missiles fired from allied Titans to home them on an enemy within range. This allows Titans more forward on the battlefield to accurately guide missiles fired by allies further to the rear, though all such missiles must be directed at a single titan. Chains of Titans with relays can be coordinated to allow highly accurate missile fire across large distances.
"Ready. Jumping now... Position established, I see them and I see you."
