Overview
Map of the Realm of the Chaos Gods
Warpspace is a mirror dimension of pure energy. Existing as a mirror to our own reality, the
Materium
, it is the domain of the
Gods of Chaos
.
These Gods dwell in their own realms, perpetually battling for one another in a struggle known as the
Great Game
. The size of these realms expands and contracts as the power of the Warp ebbs and flows.
The Warp's existence is fueled by the emotions and souls of all sentient beings in the Materium.
Warpspace is without form and the laws of time and space do not apply there, for both size and time are simultaneously infinite and irrelevant within The Warp.
Its energies are in constant turmoil, subject to endless disturbances.
The common analogy used to describe Warpspace compares the Warp to a vast sea of energy, which is subject to constant movement, currents, undertows, etc. Immaterial space and real space bear a relationship as the dimensions parallel with each other. The fact that they share this relationship allows a Warp-capable craft to enter the Warp, carried for a time along the Warp flows until reemerging into real space a distance away from its starting point. The common metaphor used for Warp-jumping compares the Warp to a fast flowing stream. Its motionless banks represent real space. A leaf dropped into the water upstream will be carried along by the currents. This is a useful metaphor in understanding Warpspace, although the Warp is far more complex in its movements than a linear stream. The Warp moves in endlessly unpredictable and convoluted patterns.
The Warp is the final destination of the deceased souls of most races of the Galaxy. These souls will swirl endlessly within the Chaotic eddies of the Warp, and many are consumed by preying
Daemons
.
Perhaps fortunately for the vast majority, particularly the minimally psychic, they swiftly lose any sentience and will perceive only the nothingness of oblivion.
The
Craftworld Eldar
use
Spirit Stones
to protect their departed souls from becoming the playthings of
Slaanesh
.
While the
Harlequin
Eldar
rely on the protection of the
Laughing God
.
The
Imperials
believe that the
Emperor
will protect a virtuous soul once it has entered the Warp
while the
Orks
are spirited to the
Great Green
under the protection of
Gork and Mork
.
The Warp is born from the thoughts, dreams, and emotions of every psychically attuned sentient race in the
Galaxy
. Every emotion and action in the
Materium
feeds the Warp and it is reflected back, creating its own reality. Should the races of the Galaxy somehow be cut off from the Warp, its malevolent entities would ultimately weaken and starve.

The Ætheric Dominions
The eight pointed star of Chaos representing the Ætheric Dominions
There are eight
Ætheric Dominions
, the aspects of Chaos within the
Warp
.
Encroaching Ruin
: Chaos in its purest form. It hungers only for destruction, that all things mortal meet their end and be forgotten. To this singular end it moves inexorably, driven by a nightmarish purpose which subsumes the petty divisions of daemonkind.
Formless Distortion
: Even as Daemons manifest as obscene parodies of mortal forms, the true essence of Chaos is endlessly shifting and unknowable, twisting, changing and perverting everything it touches. Some Daemons who cross into the
Materium
embody this to its fullest extent, shaping themselves into agglomerations of immaterial flesh, for whom death is simply one component of the eternal metamorphosis they would inflict upon the material world.
Heedless Slaughter
: The fury of battle and the red joy of life’s final end. For some among the hordes of the Warp, the only goal is to fight and to die – it matters not where or why as long as blood flowed. Such entities would appear garbed in the trappings of conquerors and executioners, caring only for the tally of skulls and death they might reap from the mortal world, irrespective of such concerns as friend or foe.
Putrid Corruption
: A slow corruption, rotting away body and soul, with no final release in death. Among the hosts of Chaos there were those who cared nothing for victory or defeat, only that suffering was spread to as many as possible. Such creatures manifest into the material world in disease and filth, content to spread their vile gifts to the world of mortals.
Ravenous Dissolution
: Such is the hatred that swirls within the Warp that it encompasses all things, and this hatred extends even to itself. To expect rational and sane logic from creatures such as these would be foolish, for Chaos was both its name and nature. Yet, in its self-destructive hatred there is no ally to be found, only a new and more unpredictable foe.
Malevolent Artifice
: Just as Chaos reflects back a twisted mockery of humanity’s every facet, so too is the very drive to create perverted into a malevolent and destructive force within the Immaterium. Conjured forth into realspace, such daemons harness the works of mortals as a vector for their own annihilation, their machine-like forms at once a mimicry of flesh and artifice, every action made to demonstrate their supremacy over both mortal beings and everything they deigned to create.
Infernal Tempest
: Some Daemons are brought forth a maelstrom of raw warpstuff with them, manifesting the energy of the Immaterium as sheer elemental power. Around these entities roiled tempests of prismatic fire, the air is riven with crackling arcs of lightning as the earth twists into fragments of shimmering crystal. To these Daemons there is no higher purpose than the promulgation of that power and of its profligate use on the battlefields of the material realm.
Rapturous Sensation
: A maddening screech of sensation and wild impulses. For some among the forces of Chaos the ends of violence truly mattered not, merely that they were there to take part and to experience its vicissitudes, inflicting overwhelming pain and gorging on mortals’ fear. These daemonkind revel in the sensory overload of war, bounding over shell-sundered battlefields to deliver blissful death as they exulted in each blinding flash and deafening blast.
Warp Travel
Main article:
Warp jump
The Warp is an important factor in the survival of the human race. Spacecraft, capable of voyaging thousands of light-years in a matter of days, travel across the Warp. By such fragile means, humanity is bound together in a single Imperium. The Emperor's will may be mighty, but his reach is long only because Warpspace may be crossed by his fleets.
A spaceship may enter the Warp through the use of
Warp drives
. This is the means by which spacecraft effectively travel faster than the speed of light. This is achieved because Warpspace is a domain of pure energy, where spacecraft can navigate between streams, as in an ocean. The Imperium uses
Navigators
, a sub-race of humans, for this purpose. Time also proceeds a great deal slower- or faster- in the Warp than in the material universe, resulting in forms of time stasis, acceleration, reversal, and other chaotic violations of physics. While this solution is effective, it is far from perfect.
Long-distance journeys take months or even years, and the timing itself is unpredictable due to the very nature of the Warp.

The Warp is an extremely volatile medium. At times, disturbances can turn areas of the Warp into
raging storms
of incomprehensibly destructive fury. These storms can last for days, months, or even centuries.
Even more devastating are
Warp Rifts
, which are tears in reality that link The Warp to the
Materium
. These rifts are highly dangerous and allow the Realm of
Chaos
to spill into our own.
Notable Warp Rifts include the
Eye of Terror
,
Maelstrom
, and
Great Rift
.
Warp Entities

List of Warp Entities
Main article:
Daemon
The Warp, though utterly hostile to creatures of the material realm, is home to its own form of life.
These are often voracious entities which are drawn to the psychic emanations of mortals of real space - these creatures include the
Vampyre
,
Psychneuein
,
Astral Spectre
,
Astral Hound
,
Enslaver
and most terrifying and numerous of all, the
Daemons of Chaos
.
Ships traveling in the Warp are shielded against attacks from these creatures. Without these
shields
, travelers through the Warp would be consumed by daemons.
The Warp is also the realm of the four
Gods of Chaos
:
Khorne
,
Slaanesh
,
Tzeentch
, and
Nurgle
. Though the Warp and the Chaos Gods are formed of the same energy and are practically synonymous, each god has a form that embodies their personalities and dwells at the heart of their realms.
