Horus Lupercal
was one of the 20
Primarchs
created by the
Emperor
in the earliest days of the
Imperium of Man
, just after the end of the
Age of Strife
. Like the other Primarchs, Horus was scattered from
Terra
by the Gods of
Chaos
and was placed on a far-away world in an attempt to prevent the coming of the
Age of the Imperium
. Traditional accounts state that Horus was the first Primarch to be rediscovered. He was given command of the
Luna Wolves
, a Space Marine Legion created using Primarch's genetic template. With his Space Marine sons by his side, Horus waged war against the enemies of the Emperor during the
Great Crusade
. Fighting alongside his father as Lord of the Luna Wolves, he became his favoured son and beloved by most of his brother Primarchs. As result, Horus eventually rose to become
Warmaster
of the Great Crusade and was seen as second only to the Emperor himself in power and prestige.
But in spite of all of this, he was eventually corrupted by the powers of Chaos and initiated the galaxy-spanning civil war known as the
Horus Heresy
against the very Imperium he helped create.

Biography
Early Life
A younger Horus Lupercal
When Horus was scattered, his pod landed on the world of
Cthonia
, a planet close to the
Sol System
. He was discovered by the Cthonian gang overlord
Khageddon
, and given the "no-name" of
Nergüi
. Growing up for a time under Khageddon's gang, Nergüi engaged in the perpetual gang warfare beneath Cthonia's surface that dominated the world. However his life changed dramatically when he came upon the pod he had arrived to Cthonia on, now being excavated by the
Mechanicum
. Nergüi engaged in battle with the
Tech-Priests
, killing one and recovering its weapon before running back to Khageddon. Khageddon scolded Nergüi for his recklessness, saying those he killed would chase them back to their tribal lair. Khageddon refused to give Nergüi his "kill-name" over the incident, much to the young ganger's anger. However just as Khageddon predicted, Mechanicum adepts arrived at their tribal hold and began to dig through from the surface. With the chamber collapsing around them and most of the gang dying, Khageddon instructed Nergüi to slay him to earn his kill-name. After Nergüi performed the act, he suddenly gained buried memories of the
Galaxy
, technology, and himself. Even his body began to swell, seemingly awakened by a trigger. When the Tech-Priests finally arrived into the chamber a Primarch stood before him: Nergüi proclaimed himself Horus.
According to Horus himself, after his discovery he was brought from Cthonia to Terra alongside several of his elderly comrades from the gang world. He landed upon Terra to much fanfare, kneeling before the Emperor and taking an oath to serve him dutifully.
This account however is sometimes disputed, with others claiming Horus returned to
Terra
itself.
Because of this early discovery, Horus grew to be the most powerful among the Primarchs as he had grown up from a child to an adult at the side of the Emperor. For a thirty years he was the only Primarch to have been discovered. Friendship between the Emperor and Horus grew rapidly and the Emperor eventually trusted him enough to give him command of the entire force of the Imperium. The Emperor had saved Horus's life at the
Siege of Reillis
as they fought back to back. At another battle, Horus repaid this debt when he hacked the arm off a frenzied
Ork
as it tried to choke the life out of the Emperor on the planet of
Gorro
.
The first of his brother Primarchs Horus was reunited with was
Leman Russ
, who he regarded as a savage and with a degree of hidden jealousy. Despite this, he fervently followed the Emperor's wish to have him get along with Russ and the other Primarchs that will soon be rediscovered.
The Great Crusade
Horus before his corruption
As the Emperor and the Great Crusade marched on, Horus proved himself to be a tactical genius. He knew precisely which force to send and where to send it, showing no mercy to those that opposed the Emperor but sparing the innocent from unnecessary bloodshed. As the Emperor departed to find and meet with rediscovered Primarchs, Horus was left in temporary command of the Legiones Astartes and this helped prepare him for the role of Warmaster.
After the
Ullanor Crusade
, in which an Ork empire was defeated, the Emperor, considering the crusade to be Horus' greatest victory yet, saw fit to partially transfer control of the Great Crusade to Horus, raising him to the rank of
Warmaster
, the highest official beneath the Emperor himself, and granting him command over any and all Imperial forces, as well as other rights and honours. This strained Horus' relationship with several Primarch's, most notably
Angron
,
Perturabo
, and
Konrad Curze
, who felt either they deserved the title or simply didn't want to take orders from their brother.
Leman Russ
and
Lion El'Jonson
meanwhile openly accepted the decision but were clearly embittered by it,
Roboute Guilliman
,
Jaghatai Khan
, and
Ferrus Manus
supported the decision simply because of duty. But
Fulgrim
,
Mortarion
,
Sanguinius
,
Lorgar
, and
Rogal Dorn
all supported Horus' ascension to the point where they bowed their heads and meant it, and Horus grew closest to these brothers.
In these, the last years of the Great Crusade, Horus would encourage the other Primarchs to compete against each other in order to discover the strongest and most able of his companions and to improve their fighting abilities, as well as lead his own personal forces into several notable campaigns. It was after one of these campaigns - the first contact with the
Interex
— that Horus chose to exercise his right, granted by the Emperor, to rename his personal legion: The Luna Wolves were renamed the
Sons of Horus
.
But despite these accomplishments, the formation of the
Council of Terra
and his Father's return to Terra created a deeply buried resentment in Horus that, before the Heresy, not even he truly seemed to realize existed.
The Betrayal
Horus succumbs to the powers of Chaos
Unknown to Horus, his brother
Lorgar
, along with his entire legion of
Word Bearers
, had secretly fallen to
Chaos
and conspired to make Horus the Ruinous Powers' champion against the Emperor. For many years before acting openly, the Word Bearers usurped loyalist hold on their Legions by establishing
Warrior Lodges
.
The full conspiracy finally manifested during a mission on the
Feral World
Davin
; Horus was wounded
in battle
by a blade of
Nurgle
wielded by the Chaos-corrupted
Eugen Temba
. He fell unconscious and under the advice of Word Bearers First Chaplain
Erebus
the natives of the world helped to heal him. However, unknown to the desperate
Mournival
, the healers and Erebus himself had all long since become corrupted by Chaos and were orchestrating the entire series of events. Having his dying body moved to the
Serpent Lodge
, Horus was soon subjected to an ancient Chaos ritual by the Davin priests, while Erebus entered his mind disguised as the deceased
Hastur Sejanus
. This image of Sejanus showed Horus horrifying visions of the future, where the Emperor ruled as a god and had discarded the Primarchs once they had outlived their usefulness. Erebus also told Horus that the
Gods of Chaos
were peaceful beings with little interest in the
Materium
, and it was the Emperor that was intent on destroying their realm on his quest for godhood. Most disturbing for Horus, he was told that the Emperor had used the powers of the
Warp
to create the Primarchs. Horus was shown a vision of the past where all the Primarchs, himself included, were scattered across the Galaxy into a warp vortex. The scattering of the Primarchs, despite being orchestrated by Chaos instead of the Emperor, seemingly confirmed to Horus that the Emperor had used foul Warp-magics in his sons' creations. Horus saw the Emperor, who had banned any research into the Warp, as a hypocrite.
Despite realizing early on that this Sejanus was but an impostor, Horus nonetheless accepted these revelations for unknown reasons and his bitterness towards the Emperor, already growing from his fathers isolation and
Secret Project
on Terra as well as the formation of the
Council of Terra
(essentially subordinating the Primarchs to mortal humans), finally manifested in outright hostility. The only attempt to stop the conversion of Horus came from his brother
Magnus the Red
, who entered Horus's mind but was unable to interfere with the powerful rituals of the Davin Cultists or convince Horus to remain loyal to the Emperor.
Horus dealt with Magnus afterward by manipulating
Leman Russ
into launching an all-out
purge
of
Prospero
.
After his experience on Davin, Horus agreed to align with the powers of Chaos in order to overthrow the Emperor, which he had become convinced was a corrupt dictator bent on achieving godhood and forsaking his sons in favor of mortal rulers. The Warmaster soon introduced the taint to the Legions under his direct command, converting
Angron
of the
World Eaters
,
Fulgrim
of the
Emperor's Children
, and
Mortarion
of the
Death Guard
to his cause. Eventually, Horus was also able to secretly recruit
Konrad Curze
of the
Night Lords
,
Alpharius Omegon
of the
Alpha Legion
, and
Perturabo
of the
Iron Warriors
. Horus also converted the
Fabricator-General
of the
Adeptus Mechanicus
Kelbor-Hal
, founding the
Dark Mechanicum
, as well as many units of the
Imperial Army
.
Heresy
"Let the Galaxy Burn!"
Burning the Galaxy
Horus during his rebellion
Horus moved, along with several other secretly traitor legions, to
Isstvan III
, seemingly in order to suppress a rebellion and reinstate Imperial control. Once he arrived however, he sent down specially selected troops from all four of the legions with him, sending down all those he knew would never join him in open rebellion. Once they were on the planet he proceeded to
virus bomb
the entire world and killed billions of inhabitants in seconds, along with hundreds of space marines, and a ground war eliminated the remainder
. The psychic shock wave from this event was said to be louder than the
Astronomican
. Horus then redeployed his forces to
Isstvan V
where he was met by seven Space Marine legions sent to bring him to Terra to face an inquest into his actions on Isstvan III. Four of these seven legions proceeded to rebel against the Emperor. It now became obvious that Horus had massive power as he hunted down the three legions that had stayed loyal. Only a few
Space Marines
managed to escape his forces and make it back to Terra, and among those killed was
Ferrus Manus
, Primarch of the
Iron Hands
.
Eventually Horus would mount the skull of Ferrus Manus in his throne room, where he began talking to it in private and lamenting that he must rely on psychotic generals and daemons instead of true, effective strategists like Ferrus had been.
As Horus' rebellion spread, he claimed a personal fiefdom in the northern Imperium dubbed the
Dark Empire
.
Ascension
Following a failed assassination attempt by
Shadrak Meduson
after the
Battle of Dwell
, Horus regained a lost memory that the Emperor had erased, that of the Emperor's unlocking of dark powers on
Molech
. Horus
invaded
the planet hoping to gain the same abilities as his father. Horus eventually managed to enter the gate, and after an unspecified but extremely long period of time exited the Warp with his powers greatly increased. While time in the
Materium
had only been mere moments, Horus had been within the Warp for so long he had visibly aged. Inside the Warp for what seemed like an eternity, Horus had won a thousand kingdoms, amassed billions of Daemonic followers, and defied Gods. Eventually Horus forcibly acquired the same power the Emperor had gotten, but with his own force of will and without deception like his Father had. However he had refused a place within the Warp, choosing instead to reenter the Materium with his new power to make war on the Emperor. Aboard the
Vengeful Spirit
, Horus then survives an infiltration by the
Knights-Errant
led by his former
Mournival
adviser
Garviel Loken
. The attempt failed and Horus killed
Iacton Qruze
before the Knights-Errant escaped.
Horus during the Heresy at the
Battle of Trisolian
Now with the powers of a god and maintaining his previously youthful appearance with his new-found abilities
, Horus then set a course to fight his way through the Imperium in an attempt to reach Terra and, ultimately, to kill the Emperor and place himself on the throne. However at the
Trisolian
, he was confronted by Leman Russ and his
Space Wolves
, who had tracked the
Vengeful Spirit
thanks to runes planted by the Knights-Errant during the Battle of Molech. Russ and a large force of Space Wolves were able to board the
Venegeful Spirit
, and the two Primarch's came face to face. Russ was disgusted by what had become of his brother. Nonetheless Horus pleaded with Russ to join him and help in his quest to overthrow the
Emperor
and expose his lies. Surprising none, Russ rejected Horus and the two engaged in a titanic battle. Despite Horus' sorcerous powers, Russ was protected thanks to the Spear of Russ he wielded. It thus came down to a battle of sheer power, one Horus was dominating despite Russ' speed. Horus caught Russ upon his
Talon
, but Russ broke free of his armor and impaled flesh to plunge the Spear of Russ into the Warmaster's side. However Russ hesitated at the final second to deliver the killing blow, and instead only partially pierced Horus' side. The wound was still devastating, and more importantly the power of the Spear cleansed Horus of the corruption that had befallen him since Molech. For the first time in the battle, Russ saw Horus Lupercal before him, not a creature of
Chaos
.
Despite the effects of the Spear, Horus still remained committed to the Emperor's destruction and rejected Russ' offer to return to Terra and allow the Emperor to heal him. The two Primarch's again came to blows, and this time Russ was badly mauled by Horus' talon. As Horus stood over Russ and was about to deliver the final blow with
Worldbreaker
, a single Space Wolf rushed to his Primarch's aid and was swatted aside by Horus. Soon more came, and then hundreds, until Horus was swarmed by a desperate mob of Space Wolves piling upon him. The distraction gave
Bjorn
enough time to drag Russ back to his flagship
Hrafnkel
and escape. After the battle, Horus ordered Abaddon to pursue the Wolves to
Yarant
, but secretly expressed regrets that so much blood had been spilled in his war.
The wound Russ gave Horus proved far more enduring than any could imagine. Constantly plaguing by the Warmaster, at the
Battle of Beta-Garmon
the wound reopened and Horus collapsed into a coma-like state. Before he passed out, Horus demanded that
Maloghurst
issue a general summons of all the Traitor Primarch's to
Ullanor
in preparation of moving on Terra. Despite the best efforts of Maloghurst to hold the traitor war effort together, without Horus' power things began to fall apart.
Fulgrim
and
Angron
refused the summons entirely while
Mortarion
stated he would only take a summons from Horus himself. With
Abaddon
busy chasing the Wolves in the
Battle of Yarant
,
Horus Aximand
and
Falkus Kibre
vyed for leadership and undermined Maloghurst's authority. Maloghurst in desperation turned to
Lorgar
and
Zardu Layak
to revive the Warmaster. The Word Bearers revealed that part of Horus' soul was still trapped within the gate of
Molech
, and the Chaos Gods were literally tearing it apart in their squabbles over such a valuable prize. The majority of Horus' spirit refused to submit to the Dark Gods, and this combined with the doubt created by the power of the Spear of Russ had created his comatose state.
With the Sons of Horus facing destruction at
Heta-Gladius
under the leadership of Aximand, Maloghurst conducted a blood ritual with the bound Daemon
Amarok
to journey into the Warp and attempt to recover the lost piece of Horus' soul. Inside he found Horus on an eternal battlefield, waging a never-ending struggle against enemies and creatures from across time and space. This Horus thought he was still on Molech, and was unaware of what had transpired since. Maloghurst revealed the truth, and bade Horus go with him. Horus refused to submit to the Gods and free his soul from this realm, but Maloghurst attempted the ritual a second time. This time the two found themselves on
Ullanor
on the eve of the Triumph. Maloghurst begged Horus to submit to the Gods, but the Warmaster refused to be a slave. Maloghurst noted that Horus had chose this path and was no slave, and it was far too late to turn back now, the Warmaster must settle things with the Emperor and end the war. This time Maloghurst understood what must be done, and plunged a knife into Horus' wound. With Maloghurst giving his own life to awaken the Warmaster, Horus awoke and immediately took command of the Legion once more.
With Horus renewed, he traveled to the surface of Ullanor to meet with the Traitor Primarch's that had already arrived. On the surface, he met
Fulgrim
and
Lorgar
. In truth, Lorgar had planned to usurp Horus as Warmaster as he viewed him as weak and undeserving of the title. Before Lorgar's coup could be enacted, Horus revealed that he knew of his treachery thanks to the efforts of
Actaea
. With the previously enslaved Fulgrim being freed by
Zardu Layak
, Lorgar's plan fell apart completely. Horus beat Lorgar viciously and exiled him, ordering that he never enter his sight again but retaining command over the Word Bearers of Zardu Layak. Before leaving Lorgar revealed his sadness for Horus, he had become such a slave to Chaos that even he pitied him. According to Layak, by this point Horus' form was consistently shifting between various states. His pure Luna Wolf form, that of the Warmaster, that of the empowered being on Molech, and finally his "new" form that was simply a dark maw of Chaotic energy. Horus had finally thrown away the last of Lupercal, all that existed was a Slave to Darkness.
Horus then met with the other Primarch's that arrived on Ullanor:
Perturabo
,
Angron
,
Alpharius
, and
Magnus
. A second, darker triumph on Ullanor was held as the traitors arrayed their forces. After sacrificing 1/10th of their slaves to the Gods, Horus ordered all move on Terra at last.
Warmaster Horus
Terra
Horus' forces at last arrived in the
Sol System
in the
Solar War
. However during the initial phases of the battle, neither he or the
Vengeful Spirit
appeared and this led to much grim speculation by Rogal Dorn, Malcador, and others as to his true intent. Their suspicions were proven correct when a ritual conducted by
Ahriman
and the
Word Bearers
aboard
The Comet
created a massive Warp-rift directly over
Luna
, from which spilled tens of thousands of warships. At the head of the armada was the
Vengeful Spirit
, with Horus himself commanding from Lupercal's Court. Beset on all sides, the defenses of the Sol System collapsed and Horus was able to strike directly towards Terra. But as Horus besieged the Sol System in the Materium, so did the Ruinous Powers assail the Imperium in the Immaterium. The Emperor alone held back the tides of the Warp from the Sol System. As Horus finally arrived in the Sol System he appeared to the Emperor as a feral wolf, goading the Emperor and declaring him a tyrant and liar. The Emperor refused to even respond to Horus in these exchanges, looking past him to instead announce his rejection of the Ruinous Powers and declaring their puppet as nothing. As the embers of his fire died, the shadows around him drew closer and closer. As Horus arrived directly over Terra, the fire finally died and Horus gloated that the only option left for his father was to run.
Horus' war came to its climax during the
Siege of Terra
. During the Siege he was increasingly absent from direct command, something that frustrated First Captain
Abaddon
. Instead Horus spent large amounts of time inside the pocket dimension that had become
Lupercal's Court
, accompanied by
Zardu Layak
and his
Word Bearers
. Here he would fall into a comatose state, scanning the Empyrean for lore and weakening the Emperor upon their psychic battlefield within the Warp.
Horus swelled with the powers of the Chaos Gods and now commanded through fear rather than charisma. Abaddon began to become disgusted with what Horus had become, considering him now to be little more than a slave to the Chaos Gods. Zardu Layak stated that while supremely powerful, the Chaos Gods would quickly burn out Horus with their power and he had limited time left to live.
Layak's prophecy rang true, as a few months into the siege Horus had begun to display signs of senility.He recalled past glories as if they were presently occurring and called his current Emissary
Argonis
by the name
Maloghurst
. Horus was kept recused from the traitor armies, and much of the day-to-day planning in the siege fell to Perturabo.
After the setback at the
Saturnine Wall
however Horus became more directly active in the Siege's execution. He ordered Perturabo to use the
Legio Mortis
to attack the Mercury-Exultant Kill-Zone, despite its formidable defenses. When Perturabo expressed doubt in the plan Horus was adamant it would succeed, because it willed it so. Later, Horus had
Argonis
inform Perturabo that the Iron Warriors were to be dispersed across the various warfronts and that the Lord of Iron's own position would be taken by Mortarion and the Death Guard. The act caused the already-disillusioned Perturabo to quit the war effort.
Horus remained isolated aboard the
Vengeful Spirit
until the final stages of the Siege, where apparently he began to prepare for his landing to kill the Emperor personally. Horus issued his first direct command not given through Argonis in weeks when he ordered Traitor forces to capture the
Eternity Gate
.
Horus then psychically ordered Angron to find and kill Sanguinius, an act apparently more out of desperation than anything else.
The Death
Horus battles
Sanguinius
aboard the
Vengeful Spirit
Despite the loyalist success in holding the Eternity Gate, Horus' army were still on the brink of victory and soon captured the
Bhab Bastion
, Rogal Dorn's own command centre.
It was then that Horus, his mind in the Warp, intercepted a message from
Roboute Guilliman
that he and his reinforcements were a mere 9 hours away from Terra. Horus finally roused from his throne and journeyed to the bridge of the
Vengeful Spirit
.
There, he addressed his equerry
Kenor Argonis
as
Maloghurst
, saw long-dead
Zardu Layak
at his side, and stated he would finally finish the war with a daring gambit. To the shock of all present, Horus stated that he had apparently lowered the
Vengeful Spirit's
Void Shields
, inviting the Emperor himself to
teleport
aboard his flagship. This would allow Horus to slay the Emperor before Guilliman's reinforcements could arrive. With their Emperor dead, Guilliman's fleet would lose heart and scatter before the forces of the Warmaster.
Soon enough, the Emperor took the bait and He alongside
Rogal Dorn
,
Sanguinius
,
Constantin Valdor
, and their elite forces all teleported to the
Vengeful Spirit
. It was then that Horus sprung his trap, using his sorcerous connection to his flagship to scatter the loyalists throughout the vessel. He took control of many of the Emperor's own Custodes, forcing them to attack their own liegelord as the Emperor reluctantly struck them down.
Rogal Dorn was trapped in an endless desert of madness for what seemed to him to be centuries.
Horus revealed his true power and mental strength, which he had apparently been concealing in order to lure his father to him.
According to
Actae
, Horus was preparing to be elevated to a fifth
Chaos God
, using humanity just as
Slaanesh
had used the
Eldar
. All across Terra, his followers chanted the name of the soon-ascendant
Dark King
(though apparently this in fact referred to the Emperor).
Horus, as he confronts the Emperor during the climax of the Horus Heresy.
Swelling with the powers of Chaos, the fully awakened Horus drove the crew of the
Vengeful Spirit
mad with his mere presence including hardened Space Marines such as his equerry
Kenor Argonis
.
He broke down the barriers of space and time between the surface of Terra and his flagship, causing the two locations to overlap with one another and for time itself to be paused at this single monumental moment, with even the
Inevitable City
manifesting in his honour.
Still preparing to face his father, Horus deliberately let
Sanguinius
reach him within the heavily mutated
Lupercal's Court
. Planning to turn Sanguinius to Chaos so that they may confront their father together, Horus was genuinely disappointed when his brother refused his offer to join him in ascendency.
Instead, the already heavily injured Sanguinius attacked Horus with all his might, displaying ferocious combat ability. Horus still held back his true power, engaging in a purely martial battle with Sanguinius in hopes of breaking him down so he may accept the powers of the Warp. However Sanguinius fought so stubbornly and viciously that Horus grew frustrated and even took several wounds.
In the end, Horus was forced to change his plans when he detected that the Emperor was incoming. Horus finally decided to kill Sanguinius and unleashed his full power, reaching into the 8th dimension to grab Sanguinius and slam him to the ground mid-flight. Horus proceeded to batter his brother with
Worldbreaker
and impaled him several times with his
Talon
before the skull of
Ferrus Manus
. Horus let out a disappointed sigh as his brother died and his body was strung up by Daemons.
Shortly after killing Sanguinius, Horus was confronted by the Emperor. Much to Horus' annoyance, the Emperor spoke past him and instead addressed the Chaos Gods that had arrived to witness the final struggle, defying them.
In the ensuing struggle Horus, fully empowered directly by The Four Gods of Chaos, was able to overpower the Emperor after a titanic clash that transcended both space and time and spread across several dimensions.
Horus nailed the Emperor's broken but still-living body to a 5th throne he had constructed alongside those for the Chaos Gods, declaring that he was a God and would make the Emperor his puppet-slave as punishment.
However Horus was interrupted first by the
Custodian
Caecaltus Dusk
and then
Ollanius Persson
, contemptuously killing both.
Horus was next confronted by Garviel Loken, his former son who made it aboard the
Vengeful Spirit
. Loken pointed out that the Emperor had rejected to fully drink from the warp to become the
Dark King
and that Horus was the one being controlled by the Dark Powers. Loken appealed to Horus' pride, convincing him to briefly shed his tremendous Warp powers and finish the Emperor as a mere Primarch. Horus, perhaps in his arrogance, agreed since the battle was over anyway. He briefly cast off the powers of Chaos and crushed in the Emperor's skull with
Worldbreaker
as the Chaos Gods and Daemons around them angrily shouted and protested, trying to warn him of something. Horus ignored them but was shocked to find that this was simply a ruse by the Emperor. Loken and the Emperor's corpse had both been illusions, and the real Emperor launched a final assault on Horus.
Horus battles the Emperor
The Emperor used the power of the reactivated
Astronomican
to shine its light directly into Horus' brain. The Warmaster fell into agony as he desperately tried to cloak himself in Warp power once more. Much to Horus' horror, he discovered that the Chaos Gods were now teaching him a lesson of sorts by deliberately denying him their power. He came to the realisation that he had never been in control, and his Chaos masters were treating him as they would a disobedient slave. This realisation, combined with the brief absence of Warp corruption over his soul, saw the old Horus the Emperor had once loved manifest once more. He pleaded with the Emperor to kill him before the Chaos Gods reasserted control. The Emperor initially hesitated, but granted Horus a mercy and drove the
Athame
blade Ollanius had given him through His son's chest. The Emperor then channelled all of His might into the blade, obliterating Horus' form and reducing the smiling Primarch to a mere skeleton inside his charred armour. His body was watched over by the real Garviel Loken, who was heartbroken at the tragedy.
Post-Mortem
Main article:
Battle of Harmony
After the battle, the
Vengeful Spirit
was quickly placed under Abaddon's command. Abaddon found Horus's body and ordered the retreat into the
Eye of Terror
. The body of Horus is said to have been put on display in a temple, the Sons of Horus revering the Warmaster even in death. The
Neverborn
, on the other hand, remembered Horus not for his victories but his failures, referring to him as the Sacrificed King.
At the end of a series of
inter-traitor wars
, the fortress of the Sons on
Maeleum
was destroyed, and the body of Horus stolen by the
Emperor's Children
. To the disgust of the Sons, the body was used by
Fabius Bile
to create at least one clone of Horus.
Ultimately,
Abaddon
returned to
destroy
the Emperor's Children's fortress and the clone of Horus with it. At the climax of the battle, Abaddon, wielding the
Talon of Horus
, confronted the clone of Horus who was armed with
Worldbreaker
. After killing scores of Abaddon's allies, the clone of Horus caught sight of the Talon of Horus being worn by another. Horus' clone lashed out at Abaddon with Worldbreaker, but the First Captain caught it with the Talon. Worldbreaker was crushed and Horus' clone impaled by Abaddon. In its dying moments, the clone of Horus remembered who Abaddon was and acknowledged him as his son.
Wargear
By the time of the Heresy, Horus was equipped with the gigantic
Power Maul
Worldbreaker
, said to be constructed by the Emperor's own hands. His right arm wielded the
Talon of Horus
, a monstrous
Power Claw
constructed for him as a gift by the
Dark Mechanicum
's
Fabricator-General
Kelbor-Hal
. Originally, he fought with a
Power Sword
and
Twin-Linked
Bolter
.
Horus wore an enormous suit of
Terminator Armour
known as the
Serpent's Scales
.

Notes
The creatures of the Warp are just "aliens" too, but they are not life forms as we understand the term. They are not organic. They are extra-dimensional, and they influence our reality in ways that seem sorcerous to us. Supernatural, if you will. So let's use all those lost words for them... daemons, spirits, possessors, changelings. All we need to remember is that there are no gods out there, in the darkness, no great daemons and ministers of evil. There is no fundamental, immutable evil in the cosmos. It is too large and sterile for such melodrama. There are simply inhuman things that oppose us, things we were created to battle and destroy.
